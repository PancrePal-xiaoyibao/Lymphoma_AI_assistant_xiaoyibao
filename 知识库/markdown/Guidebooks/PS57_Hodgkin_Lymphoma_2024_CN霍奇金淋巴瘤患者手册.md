# Introduction

"Lymphoma" is a general term for a group of blood cancers that originate in the lymphatic system. The lymphatic system is part of the body's immune system. It is made up of tissues and organs that produce, store and carry white blood cells throughout the body to fight infections and diseases.

There are two major types of lymphoma: Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) and nonHodgkin lymphoma (NHL). Both types are further classified into subtypes. Knowing your subtype is important because your treatment is based on the subtype. A discussion of HL subtypes begins on page 8.

This booklet provides information about HL for patients and their families. It also includes brief descriptions of normal blood and bone marrow and the lymphatic system, as well as definitions of medical terms.

Advances in the treatment of HL are resulting in improved remission (a decrease or disappearance of the signs and symptoms of the disease) and cure rates. According to the National Cancer Institute, up to  $90\%$  of all newly diagnosed cases of HL can be cured with chemotherapy and/or radiation. New treatment approaches are being studied in clinical trials for patients of all ages and at all stages of the disease.

# Hodgkin Lymphoma Basics

Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) was named after Dr. Thomas Hodgkin, a British pathologist. In 1832, Hodgkin described several cases of people with symptoms of a cancer involving the lymph nodes. The disease was called "Hodgkin's disease." It was officially renamed "Hodgkin lymphoma" when it became clear that it is caused by a change in the DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) of lymphocytes in the lymphatic system.

A lymphocyte is a type of white blood cell. In lymphoma, a lymph node or other lymphatic structure undergoes a change, called a "mutation." The abnormal cell, referred to as a "lymphoma cell" or an "HL cell," begins to multiply. Lymphoma cells may then build up in one or more lymph nodes or in other lymphoid tissues and organs, such as the spleen. They may form a mass (tumor), invade

# 引言

“淋巴瘤”是一组起源于淋巴系统的血液癌症的统称。淋巴系统是人体免疫系统的一部分。它由产生、储存并向全身输送白细胞以对抗感染和疾病的组织和器官组成。

淋巴瘤主要有两种类型：霍奇金淋巴瘤（HL）和非霍奇金淋巴瘤（NHL）。这两种类型又进一步分为亚型。了解你的亚型很重要，因为你的治疗是基于亚型的。关于HL亚型的讨论从第8页开始。

本小册子为患者及其家属提供关于霍奇金淋巴瘤（HL）的信息。还包括对正常血液、骨髓和淋巴系统的简要描述，以及医学术语的定义

霍奇金淋巴瘤（HL）治疗方面的进展正使缓解率（疾病体征和症状的减轻或消失）和治愈率得到提高。根据美国国家癌症研究所的数据，所有新诊断的霍奇金淋巴瘤病例中，多达  $90\%$  可以通过化疗和/或放疗治愈。针对各个年龄段和疾病各阶段的患者，新的治疗方法正在临床试验中进行研究

# 霍奇金淋巴瘤基础

霍奇金淋巴瘤基础霍奇金淋巴瘤（HL）以英国病理学家托马斯·霍奇金博士的名字命名。1832年，霍奇金描述了几例出现涉及淋巴结的癌症症状的病例。这种疾病曾被称为“霍奇金病”。当明确它是由淋巴系统中淋巴细胞的脱氧核糖核酸（DNA）发生变化引起时，它被正式更名为“霍奇金淋巴瘤”

淋巴细胞是一种白细胞。在淋巴瘤中，淋巴结或其他淋巴结构发生一种称为“突变”的变化。这种异常细胞，称为“淋巴瘤细胞”或“霍奇金淋巴瘤细胞”，开始增殖。然后，淋巴瘤细胞可能在一个或多个淋巴结中积聚，或在其他淋巴组织和器官中积聚，例如脾脏。它们可能形成肿块（肿瘤），侵袭

neighboring tissues, or travel from one group of lymph nodes to the next. Over time, the lymphoma cells can spread to tissues and organs outside the lymphatic system.

In HL, the accumulation of abnormal lymphocytes results in masses that are usually found in the lymph nodes and other sites in the body. See Figure 1, below.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-08-10/7b35304f-50b1-429c-9cf9-36f28179ed14/dbff2687482e14023c54aca647dc20ddeed093558a7a90d654575f12d1bbfc9c.jpg)  
Figure 1. Hodgkin Lymphoma and the Lymphatic System

The lymphatic system is part of the immune system. The normal immune system helps to protect the body from infection. The marrow, lymph nodes and spleen are parts of the immune system. There are about 600 lymph nodes throughout the body.

Lymph nodes and other lymphoid tissues that are commonly involved in lymphoma are those around the ears and jaw, in the tonsils and adenoids, in the front and back of the neck, above and below the collar bone, in the armpit, near the elbow, in the chest, in the abdomen, in the pelvis and in the groin. The spleen contains many clusters of lymphocytes that can become malignant and grow, leading to the enlargement of the spleen. The gut- associated (intestinal) lymph tissue may also be the site of lymphoma development.

邻近组织，或者从一组淋巴结转移到另一组淋巴结。随着时间推移，淋巴瘤细胞可以扩散到淋巴系统以外的组织和器官

在霍奇金淋巴瘤（HL）中，异常淋巴细胞的聚集会形成肿块，通常出现在淋巴结和身体的其他部位。见下图1。

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-08-10/7b35304f-50b1-429c-9cf9-36f28179ed14/68efd10257c0e8a193976a56d01c5dde31081c52a8d5bfdcba49c62906d1ccd6.jpg)  
图1.霍奇金淋巴瘤与淋巴系统

淋巴系统是免疫系统的一部分。正常的免疫系统有助于保护身体免受感染。骨髓、淋巴结和脾脏是免疫系统的组成部分。全身大约有600个淋巴结。

淋巴瘤常见累及的淋巴结和其他淋巴组织包括耳周和颌周、扁桃体和腺样体、颈前和颈后、锁骨上下、腋窝、肘附近、胸部、腹部、骨盆和腹股沟处的淋巴结和其他淋巴组织。脾脏含有许多淋巴细胞簇，这些淋巴细胞簇可能恶变并生长，导致脾脏肿大。肠道相关（肠）淋巴组织也可能是淋巴瘤发生的部位

Hodgkin lymphoma is distinguished from other types of lymphoma primarily by the presence of what are called Reed- Sternberg cells, named after the scientists who first identified them. Reed- Sternberg cells are large, abnormal B lymphocytes that often have more than one nucleus and an owl- like appearance. These cells can be observed under a microscope and further identified by special pathology tests. This essential information helps doctors determine a patient's HL subtype.

# Signs and/or Symptoms

Signs and/or symptoms are changes in the body that may indicate disease. A sign is a change that the doctor sees during an examination or in a laboratory test result. A symptom is a change that a patient can see and/or feel.

A person who has signs or symptoms that suggest the possibility of lymphoma is usually referred to a specialist called a "hematologist- oncologist." A hematologist is a doctor who has special training in disorders of the blood, and an oncologist is a doctor who has special training in cancer. Doctors with training in both hematology and oncology have particular expertise in treating blood cancers such as leukemia, lymphoma and myeloma.

It is important to point out that the signs and symptoms of HL can also be caused by other, less serious conditions. Check with your doctor if you have any of the following signs and/or symptoms:

- Painless, swollen lymph nodes in the neck, underarm or groin*- Unexplained fever (above 100.4°F)**- Drenching night sweats**- Unexplained weight loss (more than 10% of your body weight)**- Itchy skin without a rash or other explanation- Fatigue, extreme tiredness or lack of energy- Loss of appetite- Persistent cough and shortness of breath (due to enlarged lymph nodes in the chest)- Abdominal pain or swelling and feeling of fullness (due to an enlarged spleen)- Occasional pain in lymph nodes after drinking alcohol

*Make sure to let your doctor know if you recently received a COVID- 19 vaccine, as some people have enlarged lymph nodes afterwards.

**Indicates a "B symptom." B symptoms are an important part of staging HL and determining a patient's prognosis (chance of recovery).

霍奇金淋巴瘤与其他类型淋巴瘤的主要区别在于存在所谓的里德- 斯腾伯格细胞，该细胞以首次鉴定出它们的科学家命名。里德- 斯腾伯格细胞是大型异常B淋巴细胞，通常有一个以上细胞核且呈猫头鹰样外观。这些细胞可在显微镜下观察到，并通过特殊病理测试进一步鉴定。这些重要信息有助于医生确定患者的霍奇金淋巴瘤亚型。

# 体征和/或症状

体征和/或症状是身体可能表明疾病的变化。体征是医生在检查期间或实验室检测结果中看到的变化。症状是患者能看到和/或感觉到的变化。

出现提示可能患有淋巴瘤的体征或症状的人通常会被转诊给一位名为“血液肿瘤学家”的专科医生。血液学家是接受过血液疾病专项培训的医生，肿瘤学家是接受过癌症专项培训的医生。接受过血液学和肿瘤学双重培训的医生在治疗白血病、淋巴瘤和骨髓瘤等血液癌症方面有特定专长

重要的是要指出，霍奇金淋巴瘤（HL）的体征和症状也可能由其他不太严重的病症引起。如果你有以下任何体征和/或症状，请咨询你的医生：

{ 颈部、腋下或腹股沟*无痛性肿大的淋巴结  { 不明原因发热（高于100.4华氏度）**  { 严重的夜间盗汗  { 原因不明的体重减轻（超过体重的10%）**  { 无皮疹或其他解释的皮肤瘙痒  { 疲劳、极度疲倦或缺乏精力  { 食欲不振  { 持续咳嗽和呼吸急促（由于胸部淋巴结肿大）

{ 腹痛或肿胀以及饱胀感 （由脾肿大引起）

饮酒后淋巴结偶尔疼痛

如果你最近接种了新冠疫苗，一定要让你的医生知道，因为有些人接种后会出现淋巴结肿大

**表示“B症状”。B症状是霍奇金淋巴瘤分期以及确定患者预后（恢复几率）的重要部分。

# Diagnosis

If you have signs or symptoms that suggest that you may have HL, exams and tests will be done to find out if you have the disease and, if so, to determine the exact subtype. Obtaining a precise diagnosis helps your doctor to:

$\bigcirc$  Estimate how your disease will progress  $\bigcirc$  Determine the appropriate treatment

Patient Evaluation. If you have signs or symptoms of lymphoma, your doctor will perform a physical examination and take a thorough medical history. Your medical history may include information about past illnesses, injuries, treatments and medications. Some illnesses run in families, so your doctor may also ask about the health of your blood relatives.

The doctor will ask about any signs and/or symptoms you are experiencing and then conduct a physical examination. It is important for the doctor to be aware of any of the following signs and/or symptoms, including, but not limited to: fevers, night sweats, unexplained weight loss, itchy skin, fatigue, and occasional pain in lymph nodes after drinking alcohol.

During the physical examination, the doctor may listen to your lungs and heart and carefully examine your body for any indications of infection and disease. The physical examination should include the doctor's assessment of all accessible lymph node groups in the neck, underarms and groin. The doctor will also palpate (check by feeling) the size of organs such as the spleen and liver.

Biopsy. A biopsy, generally of an enlarged lymph node, is needed to diagnose HL. Biopsy is the removal of cells for examination by a pathologist or hematopathologist; these are doctors who have special training in diagnosing blood diseases by studying cells under a microscope.

There are several different types of biopsies. These procedures are used to detect cancer in cells and tissues:

- Fine needle aspiration/fine needle biopsy—a thin, hollow needle is inserted through the skin into the lymph node or other suspicious area, then a small sample of cells and fluid (called "aspirate") is suctioned out- Core needle biopsy—similar to a fine needle biopsy, but uses a larger needle to remove a small core of tissue- Incisional biopsy—a surgeon will cut into the skin to remove a small area of tissue- Excisional biopsy—a surgeon will cut through the skin to remove an entire lymph node

The lymph node tissue sample that can be obtained through a fine needle aspiration is not sufficient for the hematopathologist to make a conclusive

# 诊断

如果你有提示可能患有霍奇金淋巴瘤（HL）的体征或症状，将会进行检查和测试以确定你是否患有该疾病，如果患有，还将确定确切的亚型。获得准确的诊断有助于你的医生：

{ 评估你的疾病将如何进展

{确定合适的治疗方法

{确定合适的治疗方法患者评估。如果你有淋巴瘤的体征或症状，你的医生会进行身体检查并了解详尽的病史。你的病史可能包括过去的疾病、损伤、治疗和药物的信息。有些疾病会家族遗传，所以你的医生可能还会询问你的血亲的健康状况。

医生会询问你正在经历的任何体征和/或症状，然后进行身体检查。医生需要知晓以下任何体征和/或症状，这很重要，包括但不限于：发热、夜间盗汗、不明原因的体重减轻、皮肤瘙痒、疲劳以及饮酒后淋巴结偶尔疼痛

在体格检查期间，医生可能会听诊你的肺部和心脏，并仔细检查你的身体是否有任何感染和疾病的迹象。体格检查应包括医生对颈部、腋窝和腹股沟所有可触及的淋巴结群的评估。医生还会触诊（通过触摸检查）脾脏和肝脏等器官的大小

活检。通常需要对肿大的淋巴结进行活检来诊断霍奇金淋巴瘤（HL）。活检是获取细胞以供病理学家或血液病理学家检查；这些医生经过专门培训，通过在显微镜下研究细胞来诊断血液疾病。

有几种不同类型的活检。这些程序用于检测细胞和组织中的癌症：

{ 细针抽吸/细针活检——将一根细的空心针通过皮肤插入淋巴结或其他可疑区域，然后吸出一小部分细胞和液体（称为“抽吸物”）

{核心针活检——类似于细针活检，但使用更大的针头取出一小部分组织核心

{切取活检——外科医生会切开皮肤以取出一小块组织

{切除活检——外科医生会切开皮肤以切除整个淋巴结

通过细针抽吸取获取的淋巴结组织样本不足以让血液病理学家做出定论

diagnosis. The preferred and most common type of biopsy is called an incisional or excisional biopsy, in which part of, or the whole lymph node is typically removed (excised). If the lymph node is just under the skin, the biopsy procedure is usually simple and can sometimes be done with a numbing medication (local anesthetic). If the lymph node is inside the chest or abdomen (stomach area), the patient may be sedated or receive general anesthesia.

The hematopathologist examines the samples using a microscope to look for cancer cells. If Reed- Sternberg cells are found in the lymph node sample, the hematopathologist will make a diagnosis of "classical HL" (often abbreviated as "cHL"). In the past, there was another less common but distinct subtype of Hodgkin lymphoma, called "nodular lymphocyte- predominant Hodgkin lymphoma" (NLPHL); however, that subtype has been reclassified as nodular lymphocyte- predominant B- cell lymphoma (NLPBL).

Hodgkin lymphoma may be difficult to diagnose because the Reed- Sternberg cells may comprise only 0.1 to 10 percent of the biopsy tissue sample, so it is important for it to be analyzed by a specialist with experience in diagnosing HL. Pathology slides may be sent to a specialty center for confirmation of the diagnosis.

Slides are prepared from the biopsy sample by placing the tissue in a preservative and staining it with dyes. Then the cells are examined under a microscope. The distinctive patterns of lymph node abnormalities that are characteristic of HL are visible under the microscope and can help the hematopathologist categorize the patient's disease into one of several HL subtypes (see Table 1 on page 9).

Biomarker Tests. These tests use a sample of tissue, blood, or other body fluid to check for certain genes, proteins, or other molecules that may be a sign of a disease or condition such as cancer. Biomarker testing can also be used to check for certain changes in a gene or chromosome that may increase a person's risk of developing cancer or other diseases. Biomarker testing may be done with other procedures, such as biopsies, to help diagnose some types of cancer. It may also be used to help plan treatment, find out how well treatment is working, make a prognosis, or predict whether cancer will come back or spread to other parts of the body. Also called molecular profiling and molecular testing, these types of tests include.

Immunophenotyping. This laboratory test can detect specific cancer cells based on the types of antigens or proteins on the surface of the cells. Immunophenotyping is used to help diagnose specific types of leukemia and lymphoma.

In this test, a sample of cells is treated with special antibodies that only bind to cells that have a specific antigen on them. The cells are then passed through a laser beam. If the cells have the special antibodies attached to them, they will give off light.

诊断。活检的首选且最常见类型称为切取活检或切除活检，通常会切除部分或整个淋巴结。如果淋巴结就在皮肤下，活检过程通常很简单，有时可以用麻醉药物（局部麻醉剂）完成。如果淋巴结在胸部或腹部（胃部区域）内，患者可能会被镇静或接受全身麻醉。

血液病理学家使用显微镜检查样本以寻找癌细胞。如果在淋巴结样本中发现里- 施细胞，血液病理学家将诊断为“经典型霍奇金淋巴瘤”（通常缩写为“cHL”）。过去，霍奇金淋巴瘤还有另一种较少见但独特的亚型，称为“结节性淋巴细胞为主型霍奇金淋巴瘤”（NLPHL）；然而，该亚型已被重新归类为结节性淋巴细胞为主型B细胞淋巴瘤（NLPBL）。

霍奇金淋巴瘤可能难以诊断，因为里德- 斯腾伯格细胞可能仅占活检组织样本的  $0.1\%$  到  $10\%$  ，所以由有霍奇金淋巴瘤诊断经验的专家对其进行分析很重要。病理切片可能会被送往专科中心以确认诊断。

从活检样本制备玻片，方法是将组织置于固定液中并用染料染色。然后在显微镜下检查细胞。霍奇金淋巴瘤特征性的淋巴结异常的独特模式在显微镜下可见，可帮助血液病理学家将患者的疾病分类为几种霍奇金淋巴瘤亚型之一（见第9页表1)

生物标志物检测。这些检测使用组织、血液或其他体液样本，以检查某些可能是疾病（如癌症）征兆的基因、蛋白质或其他分子。生物标志物检测还可用于检查基因或染色体的某些变化，这些变化可能会增加一个人患癌症或其他疾病的风险。生物标志物检测可能会与其他程序（如活检）一起进行，以帮助诊断某些类型的癌症。它还可用于帮助规划治疗、了解治疗效果、进行预后判断或预测癌症是否会复发或转移到身体其他部位。这些检测也称为分子谱分析和分子检测，包括：

免疫表型分析。这项实验室检测可基于细胞表面抗原或蛋白质的类型来检测特定癌细胞。免疫表型分析用于帮助诊断特定类型的白血病和淋巴瘤

在这个测试中，细胞样本会用特殊抗体处理，这些抗体只与表面带有特定抗原的细胞结合。然后让细胞通过激光束。如果细胞附着有特殊抗体，它们就会发光。

Depending on the specific type of lymphoma, the lymphoma cells can have different antigens on their surfaces. Certain antigens, called "cluster of differentiation (CD) proteins," are helpful in identifying lymphoma cells. In the majority of patients with classical HL, the antigens called CD30 and CD15 are found on the surface of the Reed- Sternberg cells. Nodular lymphocyte- predominant B- cell lymphoma cells usually express antigens CD45 and CD20, but not antigens CD15 or CD30.

Some of these tests may be repeated both during and after treatment to measure whether the treatment is working.

Next Generation Sequencing and Liquid Biopsies. Next generation sequencing (NGS) tests can rapidly examine stretches of DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid). This technology can detect mutations and other genetic abnormalities in DNA extracted from blood or bone marrow samples. Due to the small number of Reed- Sternberg cells, performing genetic analysis from tumor samples in Hodgkin lymphoma can be difficult.

The use of NGS and liquid biopsies are currently under investigation in clinical trials. These methods have the potential to become a complement to tissue biopsy in the near future. They could be particularly useful in cases in which a tumor mass is difficult to biopsy or when there is very little tissue removed through biopsy.

# Hodgkin Lymphoma Subtypes

The World Health Organization (WHO) classifies Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) into two main subtypes:

- Classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL)- Nodular lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin lymphoma (NLPHL)*

*Note: The WHO continues to use the term NLPHL (so as not to interfere with ongoing clinical trials) but states that "NLPHL may be more accurately called nodular lymphocyte- predominant B- cell lymphoma (NLPBL)." WHO is preparing to adopt this new name. NLPBL will be considered a separate disease and not a Hodgkin lymphoma subtype.

Classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) is characterized by the presence of Reed- Sternberg cells. About 95 percent of HL patients have the classical subtype, so it is often simply referred to as "Hodgkin lymphoma." Classical Hodgkin lymphoma is further classified into four subtypes (see Table 1 on page 9), each with distinctive characteristics. Nodular lymphocyte- predominant Hodgkin lymphoma (NLPHL) is distinguished by the presence of lymphocyte- predominant cells, sometimes termed "popcorn cells," which are a variant of Reed- Sternberg cells. When the doctor is making treatment decisions, the HL subtype is an important consideration.

根据淋巴瘤的具体类型，淋巴瘤细胞表面可能有不同的抗原。某些被称为“分化群（CD）蛋白”的抗原有助于识别淋巴瘤细胞。在大多数经典霍奇金淋巴瘤患者中，称为CD30和CD15的抗原存在于里- 施细胞的表面。结节性淋巴细胞为主型B细胞淋巴瘤细胞通常表达CD45和CD20抗原，但不表达CD15或CD30抗原

其中一些检查可能在治疗期间和治疗后重复进行，以评估治疗是否有效

下一代测序和液体活检。下一代测序（NGS）检测可以快速检测长段的DNA（脱氧核糖核酸）。这项技术可以检测从血液或骨髓样本中提取的DNA中的突变和其他基因异常。由于里德- 斯腾伯格细胞数量少，对霍奇金淋巴瘤的肿瘤样本进行基因分析可能很困难。

目前正在临床试验中研究NGS和液体活检的应用。这些方法在不久的将来有可能成为组织活检的补充。在肿瘤块难以活检或通过活检取出的组织非常少的情况下，它们可能特别有用

# 霍奇金淋巴瘤亚型

世界卫生组织（WHO）将霍奇金淋巴瘤（HL）分为两大主要亚型：

经典霍奇金淋巴瘤（cHL）

{结节性淋巴细胞为主型霍奇金淋巴瘤（NLPHL）*

*注：世界卫生组织（WHO）继续使用NLPHL这一术语（以免干扰正在进行的临床试验），但指出“NLPHL可能更准确地称为结节性淋巴细胞为主型B细胞淋巴瘤(NLPBL)”。WHO正准备采用这个新名称。NLPBL将被视为一种独立疾病，而非霍奇金淋巴瘤的亚型

经典型霍奇金淋巴瘤（cHL）的特征是存在里德- 斯腾伯格细胞。约95%的霍奇金淋巴瘤患者为经典型亚型，因此通常简称为“霍奇金淋巴瘤”。经典型霍奇金淋巴瘤进一步分为四种亚型（见第9页表1)，每种亚型具有独特特征。结节性淋巴细胞为主型霍奇金淋巴瘤（NLPHL）的特征是存在淋巴细胞为主型细胞，有时称为“爆米花细胞”，这是里德- 斯腾伯格细胞的一种变异型。当医生制定治疗方案时，霍奇金淋巴瘤的亚型是重要的考虑因素。

# Staging

After a person is diagnosed with HL, doctors use imaging and blood tests, and sometimes bone marrow biopsies, to determine if the cancer cells have spread within the lymphatic system and/or to other parts of the body. This determination, called "staging," provides valuable information for treatment planning. A series of tests are done to help determine the patient's stage of HL.

Imaging Tests. Imaging tests make "pictures" (images) of the inside of the body and can show where the cancer is located. One example is the simple imaging test called an "x- ray." Imaging tests are a very important part of the staging and management of HL. Your doctor may first order imaging tests when your medical history and physical examination suggest a possible diagnosis of HL. The imaging test(s) may show enlarged lymph nodes in the chest or abdomen, or both. Tumor masses can also occur outside the lymph nodes in the lungs, bones or other body tissue.

It is important to note that imaging tests, as is the case with virtually all medical tests, can sometimes have "false positive" results. For example, findings that appear to show tumor masses could actually be related to something else, like infection or inflammation. Therefore, these tests need to be interpreted carefully, taking into consideration all aspects of the patient's situation.

The imaging tests may include:

- Chest x-ray. This test produces a black and white "picture" of the inside of the chest that shows the heart, lungs, airways and blood vessels. It is often one of the first tests performed to evaluate symptoms of cough, chest pressure, or shortness of breath. It may show a mass between the lungs (the area between the lungs is called the "mediastinal" area). Although not commonly used for this purpose, the doctor can also see lymph nodes on an x-ray image and note if any lymph nodes are enlarged.

- Computed tomography (CT) scan. A CT scan, also referred to as a "CAT scan," uses special x-ray equipment to take multiple images of areas inside the body from different angles. A computer then processes this information and produces one detailed picture. For certain CT procedures, a special dye (called a "contrast" dye) is used to highlight specific areas inside the body, resulting in clearer pictures. The patient may drink the contrast dye, and/or it may be injected into a vein. Patients may have CT scans of all the areas where lymph nodes are present, which could include the neck, arms, chest, abdomen and/or pelvis, to identify areas of disease involvement. A CT scan can also show whether there is lymphoma in the lungs, liver and other organs.

- Positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) scan. This procedure combines a PET scan with a CT scan. A PET-CT scan provides a more detailed image of areas inside the body than either scan can produce

# 分期

一个人被诊断为霍奇金淋巴瘤（HL）后，医生会通过影像学检查和血液检测，有时还会通过骨髓活检，来确定癌细胞是否已在淋巴系统内扩散和/或扩散到身体的其他部位。这一确定过程称为“分期”，为治疗方案的制定提供重要信息。会进行一系列检查以帮助确定患者霍奇金淋巴瘤的分期。

影像学检查。影像学检查生成人体内部的“图像”，并能显示癌症的位置。一个例子是称为“X光”的简单影像学检查。影像学检查是霍奇金淋巴瘤（HL）分期和管理的非常重要的一部分。当你的病史和体格检查提示可能患有霍奇金淋巴瘤时，你的医生可能首先会安排影像学检查。影像学检查可能显示胸部或腹部或两者均有淋巴结肿大。肿瘤块也可能出现在淋巴结之外的肺部、骨骼或其他身体组织中。

需要注意的是，影像学检查和几乎所有的医学检查一样，有时可能会出现“假阳性”结果。例如，看似显示肿瘤肿块的发现实际上可能与其他情况有关，比如感染或炎症。因此，这些检查需要仔细解读，同时考虑患者情况的所有方面

影像学检查可能包括：

{胸部X光片。这项检查会生成胸部内部的黑白“图像”，显示心脏、肺、气道和血管。它通常是用于评估咳嗽、胸部压迫或呼吸急促症状的首批检查之一。它可能显示肺之间的肿块（肺之间的区域称为“纵隔”区域）。尽管不常用作此目的，但医生也可以在X光图像上看到淋巴结，并注意是否有淋巴结肿大。

{计算机断层扫描（CT）。CT扫描，也称为“CAT扫描”，使用特殊的X射线设备从不同角度拍摄体内区域的多张图像。然后计算机处理这些信息并生成一张详细的图像。对于某些CT检查程序，会使用一种特殊的染料（称为“造影”剂）来突出体内特定区域，从而得到更清晰的图像。患者可能会饮用造影剂，和/或它可能被注射到静脉中。患者可能会对存在淋巴结的所有区域进行CT扫描，这些区域可能包括颈部、手臂、胸部、腹部和/或骨盆，以确定疾病累及的区域。CT扫描还可以显示肺部、肝脏和其他器官是否有淋巴瘤。

{正电子发射断层显像- 计算机断层扫描（PET- CT）检查。这一种程序将正电子发射断层扫描（PET）与计算机断层扫描（CT）相结合。正电子发射断层扫描- 计算机断层扫描（PET- CT扫描）提供的体内区域图像比单独的任何一种扫描都更详细

alone. A PET scan is an imaging technique that produces a 3D image of functional processes in the body. It is sometimes referred to as an "FDG- PET scan" because a small amount of fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG), a radioactive glucose, is injected into the patient and absorbed by tissue cells. The imaging device detects the radiation given off by the FDG and produces color- coded images that show differences between normal and cancerous tissues: areas with cancerous tissue appear brighter or "lit up" in the scan. The images from a PET- CT scan frequently help doctors to identify an appropriate biopsy site. Before treatment, doctors may view PET- CT scans to determine the stage of HL. After treatment, PET- CT scans may be used to assess treatment response.

- Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan (in select cases). The scanners for MRIs use powerful magnetic fields and radio waves that are processed by a computer to create clear and detailed cross-sectional images (slices) of the body. These "slices" can then be displayed on a video monitor and/or saved on a disk for future analysis. MRI scans are rarely used to diagnose HL; however, doctors may use them for close examination of the spinal cord or the brain if there is a possibility that the disease has spread to these areas. Since MRI imaging does not use radiation, it may also be used during pregnancy to protect the unborn baby.

Blood Tests. Blood tests cannot be used to detect HL, but they can help the doctor obtain information about the stage of the disease and determine if patients can tolerate certain treatments.

- Complete blood count (CBC). This test measures the number of blood cells in a sample, including red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets. Low numbers of red blood cells, white blood cells or platelets may indicate that lymphoma is present in the bone marrow and/or blood. Additional tests may be done to determine the ratio between two different types of white blood cells (lymphocytes and monocytes), which can help to predict the outcome of the disease.

- Comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP). This test measures 14 different substances in the blood. It can detect a range of abnormalities in blood sugar and nutrient balance, and also evaluate liver and kidney health.

- Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). This test is done to determine the rate at which the red blood cells settle to the bottom of a tube. This "sedimentation" rate is a measure of how much inflammation is in the body. Inflammation is the body's attempt to heal itself. The ESR may be higher than normal for some people with HL.

- Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). This is a protein, normally present in most cells, which is released into the blood when a cell is damaged. A high level of LDH in the blood may indicate a number of conditions. The LDH level can be higher than normal in people with HL when the cancer is more active and causing more damage to cells.

单独进行。正电子发射断层扫描（PET 扫描）是一种生成人体功能过程的三维图像的成像技术。它有时被称为“FDG- PET 扫描”，因为会向患者注射少量放射性葡萄糖氟脱氧葡萄糖（FDG），并被组织细胞吸收。成像设备检测 FDG 释放的辐射，并生成彩色编码图像，显示正常组织和癌组织之间的差异：癌组织区域在扫描中显得更亮或“发亮”。正电子发射断层扫描与计算机断层扫描联合成像（PET- CT 扫描）的图像常帮助医生确定合适的活检部位。治疗前，医生可能查看 PET- CT 扫描以确定霍奇金淋巴瘤（HL）的分期。治疗后，PET- CT 扫描可用于评估治疗效果。

{磁共振成像（MRI）扫描（在某些特定病例中）。扫描仪

{磁共振成像（MRI）扫描（在某些特定病例中）。扫描仪对于核磁共振成像（MRIs），使用强大的磁场和无线电波，这些由计算机处理以创建身体清晰详细的横截面图像（切片）。然后这些“切片”可以显示在视频监视器上和/或保存到磁盘上以供未来分析。核磁共振扫描很少用于诊断霍奇金淋巴瘤（HL）；然而，如果有疾病可能已扩散到这些区域的情况，医生可能会用它们来仔细检查脊髓或大脑。由于核磁共振成像不使用辐射，它也可在怀孕期间使用以保护未出生的婴儿。}

正电子发射断层显像计算机断层扫描（PET- CT）比这两种扫描中的任何一种都能提供体内区域更详细的图像血液检测。血液检测不能用于检测霍奇金淋巴瘤，但它们可以帮助医生获取关于疾病分期的信息，并确定患者是否能耐受某些

{全血细胞计数（CBC）。该测试测量样本中血细胞的数量，包括红细胞、白细胞和血小板。红细胞、白细胞或血小板数量低可能表明淋巴瘤存在于骨髓和/或血液中。可能会进行额外的测试来确定两种不同类型白细胞（淋巴细胞和单核细胞）之间的比率，这有助于预测疾病的预后。}

{全面代谢检查（CMP）。这项检查测量 14 种不同的血液中的物质。它可以检测血糖和营养平衡的一系列异常情况，还能评估肝肾健康。}

{红细胞沉降率（ESR）。进行该测试是为了确定红细胞沉降到试管底部的速率。这种“沉降”速率是衡量体内炎症程度的一个指标。炎症是身体自我修复的一种尝试。对于一些霍奇金淋巴瘤（HL）患者来说，红细胞沉降率（ESR）可能高于正常水平}

{乳酸脱氢酶（LDH）。这是一种通常存在于大多数细胞中的蛋白质，当细胞受损时会释放到血液中。血液中乳酸脱氢酶水平升高可能提示多种情况。当霍奇金淋巴瘤（HL）患者的癌症更活跃并对细胞造成更多损伤时，其乳酸脱氢酶水平可能高于正常水平}

Liver and kidney function tests. These tests measure chemicals that are made or processed by the liver and kidneys. High or low levels of these chemicals in the liver may signal that the cancer has spread to the liver. High levels of creatinine in the kidneys may mean that HL (or some other disease) has damaged the kidneys.

Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis B testing. Tests for both HIV and hepatitis B are a recommended part of the pretreatment workup for patients with HL, because these diseases can affect cancer treatment. If a patient has HIV, treating it will improve how well the cancer therapy works. Hepatitis B can also affect how well some cancer treatments work.

Heart and Lung Tests. Some HL treatments may damage the heart and/or lungs. The healthcare team may decide to do heart and lung function tests before treatment, in order to plan appropriately.

Pregnancy Test. Some cancer treatments can harm an unborn baby, so a pregnancy test is recommended before undergoing treatment. Treatment options may depend on the results. See Hodgkin Lymphoma and Pregnancy on page 41.

Bone Marrow Tests. Some patients who have been diagnosed with HL may need to undergo a bone marrow aspiration and biopsy. These tests are not typically used to diagnose HL, but they may be done after diagnosis to see if there are lymphoma cells in the bone marrow. The doctor will decide if these procedures are necessary. That determination will be based on considerations including the location of the disease in the body (see Figure 2 on page 14). A bone marrow aspiration and biopsy may not be required for patients who have early- stage HL with low- risk (favorable) clinical features, for example, no B symptoms or "bulky" disease (a large mass in the chest or a lymph node mass greater than 10 centimeters). A visualizing PET scan may also eliminate the need for a bone marrow biopsy to assess the disease.

Stages of HL. Staging for HL is based on the Lugano classification (see Table 2 on page 13). These classifications were determined at meetings of lymphoma specialists, where the systems were developed and adopted for use in patients. Hodgkin lymphoma usually starts in the upper body (above the diaphragm), in lymph nodes found in the neck, chest or armpits. The diaphragm is the thin muscle below the lungs and heart that separates the chest from the abdomen.

For example, stage IIB would indicate that the patient has:

- Involvement of two lymph node sites near each other (for example, enlarged lymph nodes in the neck and collarbone area or in the neck and the armpit)- Fever, excessive sweating and/or weight loss (B symptoms)

肝肾功能检查。这些检查测量由肝脏和肾脏生成或处理的化学物质。肝脏中这些化学物质的水平过高或过低可能表明癌症已扩散到肝脏。肾脏中肌酐水平过高可能意味着霍奇金淋巴瘤（或其他某些疾病）已损害肾脏。

人类免疫缺陷病毒（HIV）和乙肝检测。这两种检测人类免疫缺陷病毒（HIV）和乙型肝炎是霍奇金淋巴瘤（HL）患者治疗前检查的推荐项目，因为这些疾病会影响癌症治疗。如果患者感染了HIV，治疗HIV会提高癌症治疗的效果。乙型肝炎也会影响某些癌症治疗的效果

心肺检查。一些霍奇金淋巴瘤（HL）治疗可能会损害心脏和/或肺部。医疗团队可能会在治疗前进行心肺功能检查，以便进行适当的规划妊娠测试。一些癌症治疗可能会伤害未出生的婴儿，因此建议在接受治疗前进行妊娠测试。治疗方案可能取决于测试结果。详见第41页的霍奇金淋巴瘤与妊娠

骨髓检查。一些被诊断为霍奇金淋巴瘤（HL）的患者可能需要进行骨髓穿刺和活检。这些检查通常不用于诊断HL，但可能在诊断后进行，以查看骨髓中是否有淋巴瘤细胞。医生会决定这些程序是否有必要。该决定将基于包括疾病在体内的位置等因素（见第14页图2）。对于早期HL且具有低风险（有利）临床特征的患者，例如没有B症状或“大块”疾病（胸部大肿块或淋巴结肿块大于10厘米），可能不需要进行骨髓穿刺和活检。可视化PET扫描也可能消除评估疾病时进行骨髓活检的必要。

霍奇金淋巴瘤的分期。霍奇金淋巴瘤的分期基于卢加诺分类（见第13页表2）。这些分类是在淋巴瘤专家会议上确定的，在那里制定了这些系统并将其用于患者。霍奇金淋巴瘤通常始于上半身（横膈膜上方），在颈部、胸部或腋窝的淋巴结中。横膈膜是位于肺和心脏下方的薄肌肉，将胸部与腹部隔开。

例如，IIB期将表明患者患有：

两个彼此邻近的淋巴结部位受累（例如，颈部和锁骨区域或颈部和腋窝的肿大淋巴结）

发热、大量出汗和/或体重减轻（B症状）

Patients in the B symptom category sometimes require more aggressive treatments. It is important to note that even patients with stage IV (advanced stage) HL are frequently cured with treatment, despite having lymphoma in many areas of the body.

# Table 2. Lugano Classification System for Hodgkin Lymphoma (HL)

# Stage I

- HL cells found in a single lymph node region (this can include one node or a group of adjacent nodes) above the diaphragm, OR- HL cells found in one organ or site outside the lymphatic system

# Stage II

- HL cells found in two or more lymph node regions on the same side of the diaphragm, either above or below, OR- HL cells found in a lymph node area and a nearby organ outside the lymphatic system, on the same side of the diaphragm

# Stage III

- HL cells found in lymph node regions on both sides of the diaphragm (above and below), possibly with localized involvement of an organ outside the lymphatic system or the spleen

# Stage IV

- HL cells found to have spread widely into one or more organs outside the lymphatic system and possibly into nearby lymph nodes, OR- HL cells found in one organ outside the lymphatic system and also in distant lymph nodes

In addition to the stage number, the letters A, B, E or S may be used to further classify the stage of HL.

- Category A: The patient does not have B symptoms (fever, drenching night sweats and/or unexplained weight loss greater than 10 percent of body weight over 6 months).- Category B: The patient has B symptoms.- Category E: The patient has HL cells in organs or tissues outside the lymphatic system.- Category S: The patient has HL cells in the spleen.

B 症状类别的患者有时需要更积极的治疗。需要注意的是，即使是 IV 期（晚期）霍奇金淋巴瘤患者，尽管身体多个部位都有淋巴瘤，也经常通过治疗治愈

# Treatment Planning

Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) cases are generally classified into subgroups called early- stage favorable, early- stage unfavorable, and advanced stage.

Early- Stage: Stage I or II Hodgkin Lymphoma. Different scoring systems are used to determine early- stage favorable or unfavorable HL.

Within these scoring systems you will see the terms "mediastinal" and "extranodal." Mediastinal refers to the area between the two lungs. Extranodal indicates an area or organ outside of the lymph nodes.

One scoring system is from the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN), an alliance of leading cancer centers in the United States. NCCN has developed Clinical Practice Guidelines for healthcare providers who treat HL.

本图示中的示例显示了每个阶段霍奇金淋巴瘤（HL）的可能位置

# 治疗计划

霍奇金淋巴瘤（HL）病例通常被分为称为早期有利型、早期不利型和晚期的亚组

早期阶段：I期或II期霍奇金淋巴瘤。不同的评分系统用于确定早期阶段的有利或不利霍奇金淋巴瘤

在这些评分系统中，你会看到术语“纵隔的”和“结外的”。纵隔指的是两肺之间的区域。结外表示淋巴结之外的区域或器官

一个评分系统来自美国领先癌症中心联盟——美国国家综合癌症网络（NCCN）。NCCN为治疗霍奇金淋巴瘤（HL）的医疗服务提供者制定了临床实践指南

The NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines look at the factors below to determine favorable (no risk factors) or unfavorable (one or more risk factors) for early- stage I- II HL:

- Bulky mediastinal disease or bulky disease greater than 10 cm- B symptoms (fever, night sweats, weight loss)- Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) greater than 50 mm/hr- More than 3 nodal sites of disease

The European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) and the German Hodgkin Lymphoma Study Group (GHLSG), two additional cancer research organizations outside the United States, also provide scoring systems to define risk factors for early- stage Hodgkin lymphoma.

Having none of the risk factors listed below is considered favorable, whereas having one or more of the risk factors is considered unfavorable.

Table 3. Risk Factors for Early-Stage (Stages I and II) Favorable or Unfavorable Hodgkin Lymphoma According to EORTC and GHLSG  

<table><tr><td>EORTC</td><td>GHLSG</td></tr><tr><td>Large mediastinal mass</td><td>Large mediastinal mass</td></tr><tr><td>Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) of 50 or higher</td><td>Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) of 50 or higher</td></tr><tr><td>4 or more involved regions</td><td>3 or more involved regions</td></tr><tr><td>Age greater than 50 years</td><td>Extranodal disease</td></tr></table>

EORTC, European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer; GHLSG, German Hodgkin Lymphoma Study Group.

Advanced Stage: Stage III or IV Hodgkin Lymphoma. The International Prognostic Score (IPS) is the most common risk stratification tool, used both nationally and internationally, for advanced Hodgkin lymphoma. Seven factors (shown in Table 4, on page 16) provide a basis for recommending either aggressive or less- intensive treatment options. The IPS assigns a point for each of the adverse prognostic factors that are present at diagnosis.

美国国家综合癌症网络（NCCN）临床实践指南会考量以下因素来确定早期I- II期霍奇金淋巴瘤（HL）的有利（无风险因素）或不利（一个或多个风险因素）情况：

{ 巨大纵隔病变或大于10厘米的巨大病变{ B症状 (发热、夜间盗汗、体重减轻){ 红细胞沉降率（ESR）大于50毫米/小时

3个以上的淋巴结病变部位

欧洲癌症研究与治疗组织（EORTC）和德国霍奇金淋巴瘤研究组（GHLSG），美国以外的另外两个癌症研究组织，也提供评分系统来界定早期霍奇金淋巴瘤的风险因素

不具有以下所列任何危险因素被认为是有利的，而具有一个或多个危险因素被认为是不利的

$\bigcirc$  Being male  $\bigcirc$  Age 45 years or older  $\bigcirc$  Stage IV disease  $\bigcirc$  Albumin level below 4 g/dL (grams per deciliter); albumin is a type of protein in the blood  $\bigcirc$  Hemoglobin level below 10.5 g/dL (grams per deciliter); hemoglobin is a protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen  $\bigcirc$  A higher- than- normal white blood cell count, generally equal to or greater than 15,000/uL (microliters)  $\bigcirc$  A lower- than- normal lymphocyte count (a type of white blood cell), generally below 600/uL (microliters) or less than  $8\%$  of the total white blood cell count

Treatment Goals. The main goal of treatment for patients with HL is to cure them of the disease. More than 80 percent of all patients diagnosed with HL can be cured by current treatment approaches. The cure rate is higher, approaching 90 percent, in younger patients and in those with early- stage favorable HL. Even in cases of advanced stage HL, the disease is often highly curable.

Most patients become long- term survivors of the disease. Other treatment goals are to:

$\bigcirc$  Maximize cures in all stages of the disease  $\bigcirc$  Minimize both short- term and long- term side effects and complications  $\bigcirc$  Weigh the risks of toxicity against treatment benefits

Typically, the team that works together to treat the patient consists of the hematologist- oncologist, a nurse practitioner and/or a physician assistant, a registered nurse, a social worker and sometimes a nurse navigator, and a financial counselor. Patients are carefully assessed, and treatment is tailored to the individual needs of each patient. Factors evaluated in treatment planning for HL patients include:

$\bigcirc$  Disease subtype  $\bigcirc$  Disease stage and category  $\bigcirc$  Whether the disease is refractory (does not respond to treatment) or has relapsed (recurred after treatment)  $\bigcirc$  Patient's age  $\bigcirc$  Coexisting diseases or conditions (for example, heart or kidney disease, diabetes)

Fertility Concerns. While many treatments for HL have little or no adverse effect on fertility, some cancer treatments can limit a person's ability to conceive or have a baby in the future. Adults of childbearing age, as well as parents of children and adolescents diagnosed with HL, are encouraged to ask their doctors for information on ways to help decrease the risk of infertility.

It may be helpful to speak to a fertility specialist before starting cancer treatment. Some methods of fertility preservation include:

- Sperm Banking. Males who want to conceive children after treatment may choose to store their semen in a sperm bank for later use.- Egg or Ovarian Tissue Freezing. A female's eggs can be removed, frozen and stored for later use. The eggs could be fertilized with sperm before freezing. Another option is for a part of the ovary that contains eggs to be removed, frozen and stored.- Ovarian Transposition. This less commonly used method, called "oophoroexy," is an option for females who will be treated with radiation therapy. An ovary is surgically transposed (moved) out of the range of the radiation beam in order to protect it.

For more information, see the free LLS booklet Fertility and Cancer.

# Treatment for Classical Hodgkin Lymphoma

New treatments may have been approved since this book was printed. Check www.LLS.org/DrugUpdates or call (800) 955- 4572.

Before treatment begins, your doctor will discuss treatment options with you. Treatment options may include standard therapy or a clinical trial. Standard therapy is treatment that is accepted by medical experts as proper treatment for a certain type of disease. A clinical trial is a research study that evaluates how well a new medical treatment works in people. A clinical trial may be your best treatment option, so it is important to discuss all your treatment options with your doctor. See page 43 for more information about clinical trials for blood cancers.

It is important to seek treatment in a center where doctors are experienced in the care of patients with Hodgkin lymphoma (HL). If time allows, you may want to seek a second opinion from another doctor or treatment center. Choosing your cancer treatment is a very important decision. It can affect the length and the quality of your life. A second opinion may help you feel more confident about your chosen treatment plan.

糖尿病）生育问题。虽然许多霍奇金淋巴瘤（HL）的治疗对生育能力几乎没有或没有不良影响，但一些癌症治疗可能会限制一个人未来受孕或生育的能力。育龄成年人以及被诊断患有霍奇金淋巴瘤的儿童和青少年的父母，被鼓励向他们的医生询问有助于降低不孕风险的方法的相关信息。

在开始癌症治疗之前，咨询生育专家可能会有帮助。一些生育保存方法包括：

{精子存储。希望在治疗后生育子女的男性可以选择将精液存储在精子库中以备日后使用。{卵子或卵巢组织冷冻。女性的卵子可以被取出、冷冻并储存起来以备日后使用。卵子在冷冻前可以用精子受精。另一种选择是取出卵巢中含有卵子的一部分，冷冻并储存。

{卵巢移位术。这种较少使用的方法称为“卵巢固定术”，是即将接受放射治疗的女性的一种选择。通过手术将卵巢移出放射束范围以保护它

Treatment Overview. Most patients with newly diagnosed HL have a high likelihood of being cured with appropriate treatment. The main treatment options for classical HL (cHL) are chemotherapy alone, or a "combined modality therapy" consisting of chemotherapy followed by radiation therapy. The treatment for nodular lymphocyte- predominant B- cell lymphoma (formerly called nodular lymphocyte- predominant Hodgkin lymphoma) requires a different treatment approach. For more information on the treatment of NLPBL, see page 33.

Chemotherapy. Chemotherapy drugs kill fast- growing cells throughout the body, including both cancer cells and normal, healthy cells. Several types of chemotherapy drugs work in different ways to eliminate lymphoma cells or stop new lymphoma cells from forming. Therefore, in many cases, more than one chemotherapy drug is used to treat HL.

Chemotherapy is usually given in treatment cycles. Each cycle is made up of a certain number of days of treatment followed by a rest period of a few days or weeks in between each cycle. In most cases, treatment is administered over the course of 1 to 3 days, depending on the particular combination of drugs.

A rest period of a few days to a few weeks following a treatment cycle allows the body to recover from the effects of chemotherapy. Then another cycle begins. Generally, a treatment cycle lasts 3 or 4 weeks. The number of cycles in a chemotherapy regimen will depend on:

- Which drugs are used- The stage and subtype of HL- How well the disease responds to treatment

Some chemotherapy drugs are given to the patient by intravenous (IV) infusion, which means they are injected slowly over a period of time, into a vein. These chemotherapy drugs are generally given through a thin, soft tube that may be called a "central venous line," "catheter," or "central line." The central line is often attached to a "port" (surgically placed under the skin in the patient's upper chest) that allows access to the central line. See Health Terms on pages 62- 67.

Radiation Therapy. Radiation therapy, also known as "radiotherapy," uses high- energy x- rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells in a small, targeted area of the body. Because radiation can also harm normal cells, when possible radiation therapy is directed only at the affected lymph node areas in order to reduce long- term side effects.

Involved- site radiation therapy (ISRT) is often used to treat HL. It selectively treats the lymph nodes or sites where the cancer is located. With a special machine, carefully focused beams of radiation are directed at the cancer. This is also called "external beam therapy" (EBT). The size of the targeted area is restricted

治疗概述。大多数新诊断的霍奇金淋巴瘤（HL）患者通过适当治疗很有可能被治愈。经典型霍奇金淋巴瘤（cHL）的主要治疗选择是单独化疗，或由化疗随后接放射治疗组成的“综合治疗模式”。结节性淋巴细胞为主型B细胞淋巴瘤（以前称为结节性淋巴细胞为主型霍奇金淋巴瘤）的治疗需要不同的治疗方法。有关结节性淋巴细胞为主型淋巴瘤（NLPBL）治疗的更多信息，请参见第33页。

化疗。化疗药物会杀死全身快速生长的细胞，包括癌细胞和正常健康细胞。几种类型的化疗药物通过不同方式来消灭淋巴瘤细胞或阻止新的淋巴瘤细胞形成。因此，在很多情况下，治疗霍奇金淋巴瘤会使用多种化疗药物

化疗通常以治疗周期进行。每个周期由一定天数的治疗组成，然后在每个周期之间有几天或几周的休息期。在大多数情况下，治疗会持续1到3天，具体取决于药物的特定组合。

一个治疗周期后的几天到几周的休息期让身体从化疗的影响中恢复。然后另一个周期开始。通常，一个治疗周期持续3到4周。化疗方案中的周期数取决于：

使用哪些药物霍奇金淋巴瘤的分期和亚型

疾病对治疗的反应程度如何

一些化疗药物通过静脉（IV）输注给患者，这意味着它们会在一段时间内缓慢注入静脉。这些化疗药物通常通过一根细而软的管子给予，这根管子可能被称为“中心静脉导管”“导管”或“中心导管”。中心导管通常连接到一个“端口”（通过手术放置在患者上胸部皮下），该端口可用于进入中心导管。参见第62- 67页的健康术语。

放射治疗。放射治疗，也称为“放疗”，使用高能X射线或其他类型的辐射来杀死身体中一个小的、特定区域的癌细胞。因为辐射也会伤害正常细胞，所以在可能的情况下，放射治疗仅针对受影响的淋巴结区域进行，以减少长期副作用。

受累部位放射治疗（ISRT）常用于治疗霍奇金淋巴瘤（HL）。它选择性地治疗癌症所在的淋巴结或部位。使用特殊机器，将精心聚焦的辐射束对准癌症。这也被称为“外照射疗法”（EBT）。靶区的大小受到限制

to minimize radiation exposure to adjacent, uninvolved organs, and to decrease the side effects associated with radiation therapy.

# For more information, see the free LLS booklet External Beam Radiation Therapy.

In recent years, proton therapy has been introduced in a limited number of cancer centers to treat HL found in the chest. This therapy uses a beam of protons instead of photons or electrons as the source of radiation, and it allows for precise delivery of the radiation to the malignant (cancerous) tissue. Proton therapy does not replace other therapies and not all patients need proton therapy. It is unclear if proton therapy is superior to standard radiation therapy.

A simulation session is needed for planning before radiation treatment starts. During the simulation session, CT or PET scans are used to take "pictures" of the tumor. Based on these scans, the treatment team takes careful measurements to determine the angles for aiming the radiation beams and the amount of radiation needed. The goal is to focus the radiation on the cancer to limit the effect on healthy tissues and organs.

During radiation treatments, you will lie on a table in the same position you were in for the simulation session. You will be alone while the radiation therapist operates the machine from a nearby room. The treatment is similar to the treatment you undergo during an x- ray; however, radiation is stronger than x- ray. Each treatment session lasts only a few minutes, but the entire session can take between 15 and 30 minutes due to the setup of the equipment.

Imaging techniques such as MRI and PET- CT scans can enhance treatment planning, and the exposure of uninvolved organs can be either reduced or avoided. Other specialized imaging techniques include:

- Four-dimensional computed tomography (4D-CT), which can adjust for movement of tumors near the breastbone (sternum), caused by the patient breathing. This is valuable for accurately treating tumors located on or near organs that move, such as those in the chest and abdomen.- Image-guided radiation therapy (IGRT), which can improve how well the radiation beam targets some tumors. The machine used for IGRT delivers radiation and, at the same time, takes images of the tumor and normal body structures. These images allow for adjustments to the beam position or radiation dose, improving the accuracy of treatment and reducing harm to normal tissue.- Three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3D-CRT), which uses images from scans to precisely plan the treatment area and design the radiation beams to conform to the shape of the tumor. This allows for the use of higher doses of radiation while sparing normal tissue.

限制靶区的大小，以最小化对邻近未受累器官的辐射暴露，并减少与放射治疗相关的副作用

近年来，质子疗法已在少数癌症中心引入，用于治疗胸部发现的霍奇金淋巴瘤（HL）。这种疗法使用质子束而不是光子或电子作为辐射源，它能够精确地将辐射输送到恶性（癌性）组织。质子疗法不会取代其他疗法，并非所有患者都需要质子疗法。目前尚不清楚质子疗法是否优于标准放射疗法

在放射治疗开始前，需要进行模拟会话以进行规划。在模拟会话期间，使用CT或PET扫描来拍摄肿瘤的“图像”。基于这些扫描，治疗团队进行仔细测量，以确定放射束的瞄准角度和所需的辐射量。目标是将辐射集中在癌症上，以限制对健康组织和器官的影响。

在放射治疗期间，你会躺在一张桌子上，姿势与模拟定位时相同。当放射治疗师在附近的房间操作机器时，你会独自一人。这种治疗与你做X光检查时的治疗相似；然而，辐射比X光更强。每次治疗疗程仅持续几分钟，但由于设备的设置，整个疗程可能需要15到30分钟。

诸如MRI和PET- CT扫描之类的成像技术可以优化治疗方案，并且可以减少或避免未受累器官的暴露。其他专门的成像技术包括：

{四维计算机断层扫描（4D- CT），可以对由患者呼吸引起的胸骨附近肿瘤的移动。这对于准确治疗位于活动器官上或附近的肿瘤非常有价值，例如胸部和腹部的肿瘤

{图像引导放射治疗（IGRT），可以提高.....

辐射束对准一些肿瘤。用于图像引导放射治疗（IGRT）的机器在发射辐射的同时，拍摄肿瘤和正常身体结构的图像。这些图像允许调整束流位置或辐射剂量，提高治疗的准确性并减少对正常组织的伤害

{三维适形放射治疗（3D- CRT），它使用

通过扫描图像来精确规划治疗区域并设计与肿瘤形状相符的辐射束。这使得能够在保护正常组织的同时使用更高剂量的辐射

Intensity- modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), which is a type of 3D- CRT. It uses smaller beams, and the strength of the beams can be changed to give higher doses to certain parts of the tumor.

If radiation therapy is being considered, patients are encouraged to carefully review the benefits and risks of these different approaches with their treating doctor.

Immunotherapy. This type of therapy uses the patient's own immune system to fight cancer. Immunotherapy can be used to treat some people with HL. The following immunotherapies are in use or under study for HL treatment:

Monoclonal Antibody Therapy. This is a type of targeted therapy. When the body's immune system identifies something harmful, such as bacteria or a virus, it produces antibodies. Antibodies are proteins that help fight infection. Monoclonal antibodies are made in a laboratory and are a type of protein that can bind to only one substance. By design, they can only attack a specific target, typically a substance on cancer cells (though sometimes they are designed to bind to a substance on immune cells, in order to improve their function). This targeting can reduce damage to normal, healthy cells. In patients with classical HL, the malignant Reed- Sternberg cells typically express a protein called CD30. Brentuximab vedotin (Adcetris®), given by IV, is classified as an antibody- drug conjugate: it's an anti- CD30 monoclonal antibody attached to a chemotherapy drug. It binds to cells that express CD30 and then enters the cancer cells. Once inside the cancer cells, it releases the chemotherapy drug. By targeting only cells that express CD30, fewer normal cells are harmed.

Immune checkpoint inhibitors. Checkpoints are molecules found on T cells, a type of white blood cell. T cells circulate throughout the body looking for signs of infection and diseases, including cancer. When a T cell comes near any type of cell, it probes (looks for) certain proteins on the cell's surface. If the T cell determines that it is a normal, healthy cell, it moves on to check other cells. If the proteins indicate that the cell is foreign or cancerous, the T cell attacks it. But cancer cells can sometimes send misleading signals to these checkpoints, telling the T cells that they are not harmful. Checkpoint inhibitors work by blocking the signals that cancer cells send to T cells. When the signals are blocked, it is more likely the T cells will distinguish the cancer cells from healthy cells and begin an attack. Nivolumab (Opolivo®) and pembrolizumab (Keytruda®), both given by IV, can be used for some patients with HL that has become refractory (come back or spread during treatment), or that has relapsed (returned) after the patient has completed other treatments. Nivolumab plus chemotherapy may soon be FDA- approved for pediatric and adult patients with previously untreated advanced stage HL.

强度调制放射治疗（IMRT），这是一种三维适形放射治疗（3D- CRT）。它使用更小的射线束，并且可以改变射线束的强度，以便向肿瘤的某些部位给予更高剂量

如果考虑进行放射治疗，鼓励患者与他们的主治医生仔细评估这些不同方法的益处和风险

免疫疗法。这种疗法利用患者自身的免疫系统来对抗癌症。免疫疗法可用于治疗一些霍奇金淋巴瘤（HL）患者。以下是用于霍奇金淋巴瘤治疗的正在使用或研究中的免疫疗法：

单克隆抗体疗法。这是一种靶向疗法。当身体的免疫系统识别到有害物，比如细菌或病毒时，它会产生抗体。抗体是有助于对抗感染的蛋白质。单克隆抗体是在实验室中制备的，是一种只能结合一种物质的蛋白质。从设计上来说，它们只能攻击特定靶点，通常是癌细胞上的某种物质（不过有时它们被设计来结合免疫细胞上的某种物质，以增强其功能）。这种靶向性可以减少对正常健康细胞的损害。在经典霍奇金淋巴瘤患者中，恶性里- 施细胞通常表达一种名为CD30的蛋白质。

维布妥昔单抗（安适利®）通过静脉注射给药，属于抗体药物偶联物：它是一种连接了化疗药物的抗CD30单克隆抗体。它与表达CD30的细胞结合，然后进入癌细胞。一旦进入癌细胞内部，它就会释放化疗药物。由于仅靶向表达CD30的细胞，正常细胞受到的伤害较少

免疫检查点抑制剂。检查点是存在于T细胞上的分子，T细胞是一种白细胞。T细胞在全身循环，寻找感染和疾病的迹象，包括癌症。如果T细胞判定它是正常、健康的细胞，它就会继续检查其他细胞。如果这些蛋白质表明细胞是外来的或癌变的，T细胞就会攻击它。但癌细胞有时会向这些检查点发送误导性信号，告诉T细胞它们没有危害性。检查点抑制剂通过阻断癌细胞发送给T细胞的信号发挥作用。当信号被阻断时，T细胞更有可能区分癌细胞和健康细胞并开始攻击。纳武利尤单抗（欧狄沃®）和帕博利珠单抗（可瑞达®）均通过静脉注射给药，可用于某些霍奇金淋巴瘤（HL）患者，这些患者的疾病已变为难治性（在治疗期间复发或转移）或在患者完成其他治疗后复发（再次出现）。纳武利尤单抗联合化疗可能很快会获得美国食品药品监督管理局（FDA）批准，用于治疗先前未接受治疗的晚期霍奇金淋巴瘤（HL）的儿科和成年患者

New types of monoclonal antibodies and checkpoint inhibitors are being studied in clinical trials to treat Hodgkin lymphoma. See Clinical Trials for Blood Cancers on page 43.

Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T- Cell Therapy. This is a type of immunotherapy that uses a patient's own T cells (a type of white blood cell) to identify and attack cancer cells. Blood is taken from the patient, and the T cells are separated out from the patient's blood and sent to a laboratory, where they are genetically modified so they will attack cancer cells. The engineered T cells are then multiplied and later reinfused into the patient's bloodstream. CAR T- cell therapy is currently under study in clinical trials for relapsed and refractory HL. See Clinical Trials for Blood Cancers on page 43.

For more information, see the free LLS booklet Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T- Cell Therapy.

See Table 6 on pages 25- 27 for drug information.

Stem Cell Transplantation. Some patients may benefit from stem cell transplantation. It is not used as an initial treatment for HL but may be recommended for people who have refractory or relapsed HL.

The goal of stem cell transplantation is to cure the patient by destroying the cancer cells with high doses of chemotherapy. These high doses of chemotherapy, however, can severely damage the stem cells in the bone marrow where new blood cells are made. Stem cell transplantation allows doctors to give patients high doses of chemotherapy and then replace the damaged stem cells with healthy stem cells.

There are two main types of stem cell transplantation:

- Autologous stem cell transplantation—a procedure in which stem cells are removed from a patient, frozen and stored, and then returned to the patient's bloodstream after the patient has had intensive chemotherapy- Allogeneic stem cell transplantation—a procedure in which patients undergo chemotherapy and then receive stem cells from a donor

Autologous Stem Cell Transplantation. In almost all cases, this is the type of stem cell transplantation used to treat HL. It remains the standard therapy for relapsed and refractory cases of HL.

The first step is to collect the patient's own stem cells after initial treatment is completed and the patient's disease is in remission. After the patient's blood is collected, the stem cells are removed from the patient's blood and are frozen and stored until they are needed for transplantation. The patient is then given high doses of chemotherapy to destroy any lymphoma cells that were not killed

正在临床试验中研究治疗霍奇金淋巴瘤的新型单克隆抗体和检查点抑制剂。详见第43页血液癌症的临床试验。

嵌合抗原受体（CAR）T细胞疗法。这是一种类型的

利用患者自身T细胞（一种白细胞）识别并攻击癌细胞的免疫疗法。从患者体内采集血液，分离出T细胞并送往实验室，在那里对其进行基因改造，使其能够攻击癌细胞。然后对改造后的T细胞进行扩增，随后重新输注到患者的血流中。嵌合抗原受体T细胞疗法（CAR T细胞疗法）目前正在复发和难治性霍奇金淋巴瘤（HL）的临床试验中进行研究

详见第43页血液癌症的临床试验

药物信息见第25- 27页的表6

干细胞移植。一些患者可能从干细胞移植中获益。它不用于霍奇金淋巴瘤（HL）的初始治疗，但可能推荐用于患有难治性或复发性霍奇金淋巴瘤的人群

干细胞移植的目标是通过高剂量化疗摧毁癌细胞来治愈患者。然而，这些高剂量化疗会严重损害骨髓中产生新血细胞的干细胞。干细胞移植使医生能够给患者使用高剂量化疗，然后用健康的干细胞替换受损的干细胞

干细胞移植主要有两种类型：

自体干细胞移植——一种程序，在此程序中，从患者体内取出干细胞，将其冷冻并储存，然后在患者接受大剂量化疗之后回输到患者的血流中

异基因干细胞移植——一种患者先接受化疗，然后从供体接受干细胞的程序

自体干细胞移植。在几乎所有情况下，这是用于治疗霍奇金淋巴瘤（HL）的干细胞移植类型。它仍然是霍奇金淋巴瘤复发和难治性病例的标准疗法

第一步是在初始治疗完成且患者疾病缓解后收集患者自身的干细胞。收集患者血液后，从患者血液中分离出干细胞并冷冻保存，直到移植时使用。然后给患者大剂量化疗以摧毁任何未被杀死的淋巴瘤细胞

during the initial treatment. After the high- dose chemotherapy is completed, the stem cells are returned to the patient's bloodstream by IV infusion (a procedure similar to a blood transfusion). The goal is to "rescue" the bone marrow from the effects of the high doses of chemotherapy, reintroducing healthy stem cells into the system in order to restore normal blood cell production.

Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplantation. This type of transplantation uses stem cells donated from someone other than the patient. It has been successful in some patients with HL after several relapses of the disease, but it is not commonly used as a treatment for HL. It is generally only done if the disease relapses after autologous transplantation.

Talk to your doctor to find out if stem cell transplantation is a treatment option for you.

For more information, see the free LLS booklet Blood and Marrow Stem Cell Transplantation.

然后给患者大剂量化疗药物，以消灭初始治疗中未被杀死的任何淋巴瘤细胞。大剂量化疗完成后，通过静脉输注将干细胞回输到患者的血流中（这一过程类似于输血）。目的是使骨髓“免受”大剂量化疗的影响，重新将健康干细胞引入体内，以恢复正常的血细胞生成

异基因干细胞移植。这种移植使用的是来自患者以外其他人捐赠的干细胞。在霍奇金淋巴瘤（HL）患者经历多次疾病复发后，这种移植对一些患者是有效的，但它并不常用于霍奇金淋巴瘤的治疗。通常仅在疾病在自体移植后复发时才进行这种移植

咨询你的医生，了解干细胞移植是否是适合你的治疗选择。

Off- Label Prescribing. Drugs that are not FDA- approved for HL can be used as an "off- label" treatment. "Off- label" prescribing is when a doctor gives a drug that is not FDA- approved to treat a patient's condition, but is FDA- approved for another condition, if the doctor feels it will benefit the patient. This is a common practice.

# Monitoring Treatment Response and Assessing Measurable Residual Disease

During and at the end of treatment, patients need to be monitored to check their response to therapy. The doctor will run tests to see how well the treatment is working. Treatment response is important in predicting long- term outcomes. Patients who fail to reach complete disease remission with the first- line (initial) treatment have a worse prognosis (predicted future outcome). So there is potential value in identifying these patients early in the course of their disease.

Imaging tests are used to distinguish between tumor and fibrous (scar) tissue. PET- CT scans help doctors determine if the disease is responding to treatment. A PET scan is typically performed after two cycles of therapy (interim PET) and at the end of therapy. The results of the interim PET often help the doctors determine the subsequent therapies. PET- CT has become the standard method for assessment of treatment response in most types of lymphoma.

The Deauville score is the internationally recognized way of using PET- CT to assess treatment response. This scale determines the "FDG uptake" (the absorption of this radioactive material by tissues) in the involved sites. The Deauville score is then used to determine if any treatment modifications are needed. A score of 1, 2 or 3 is considered negative, meaning there are no areas of concern. A score of 4 or 5 is considered positive, which suggests there are malignant (cancerous) areas of concern. The treatment team can determine how well the lymphoma is responding to treatment by observing whether this score increases or decreases as treatment progresses. FDG uptake can also occur in sites of inflammation or infection and must be interpreted carefully by your medical team.

Measurable residual disease (MRD) refers to cancer cells that may remain in the body after treatment ends. Besides the use of PET- CT scans to identify residual disease, there are other methods that are under study which may be used to complement these imaging techniques.

# 监测治疗反应和评估可测量残留病灶

在治疗期间和治疗结束时，需要监测患者以检查他们对治疗的反应。医生会进行检查以了解治疗的效果如何。治疗反应对于预测长期结果很重要。一线（初始）治疗后未能达到疾病完全缓解的患者预后（预测的未来结果）更差。因此，在疾病早期识别这些患者具有潜在价值

影像学检查用于区分肿瘤组织和纤维（瘢痕）组织正电子发射断层显像计算机断层扫描（PET- CT）有助于医生判断疾病是否对治疗有反应。通常在两个疗程的治疗后（中期PET）以及治疗结束时进行正电子发射断层扫描。中期PET的结果通常有助于医生确定后续的治疗方案。正电子发射断层显像计算机断层扫描（PET- CT）已成为大多数类型淋巴瘤治疗反应评估的标准方法

多维尔评分是国际公认的使用正电子发射断层显像计算机断层扫描（PET- CT）评估治疗反应的方法。该评分系统确定受累部位的“氟代脱氧葡萄糖摄取”（组织对这种放射性物质的吸收）。然后使用多维尔评分来确定是否需要调整治疗方案。1、2或3分被认为是阴性，意味着没有需要关注的区域。4或5分被认为是阳性，表明存在需要关注的恶性（癌性）区域。治疗团队可以通过观察该评分在治疗过程中是增加还是减少来确定淋巴瘤对治疗的反应情况。氟代脱氧葡萄糖摄取也可能发生在炎症或感染部位，必须由您的医疗团队仔细解读

可测量残留病灶（MRD）指的是治疗结束后可能残留在体内的癌细胞。除了使用正电子发射断层扫描（PET）- 计算机断层扫描（CT）扫描来识别残留病灶外，还有其他正在研究中的方法可用于补充这些成像技术。

Over the last decade, technologies to detect, genotype (analyze the genetic makeup), and monitor cancer through the blood have been developed and hold promise for revolutionizing the way in which some types of cancer are diagnosed and managed.

"Liquid biopsies" rely on the detection of tumor DNA from the blood plasma of patients. Tumor DNA is either secreted directly into the bloodstream by tumor cells or released by these cells during cell death. Next- generation sequencing (NGS) tests can detect mutations and other genetic abnormalities in the tumor DNA extracted and can also assess MRD during and after treatment in a non- invasive manner. In recent studies, higher tumor DNA concentrations were correlated with higher tumor volume measured by PET- CT scans. These new methods of MRD assessment can identify residual disease beyond the sensitivity of imaging tests and have the potential of complementing PET- CT scans in evaluating treatment response.

These methods are being explored in research studies and are not currently used in clinical practice.

# For more information, see the free LLS booklet Measurable Residual Disease (MRD).

If your doctors conclude that the treatment is working, you will either continue with the same treatment or become a candidate for less intensive therapy. For instance, your treatment team may decide that you will not receive radiation therapy after completing chemotherapy. If the treatment does not appear to be working, your treatment plan may be changed.

Treatments by Stage. Treatment options for cHL vary depending on the stage of the disease. Speak to members of your healthcare team to understand the stage of your disease and what it means for your treatment.

在过去十年里，通过血液检测、基因分型（分析基因组成）和监测癌症的技术已经得到发展，有望彻底改变某些类型癌症的诊断和治疗方式

“液体活检”依赖于从患者血浆中检测肿瘤DNA。肿瘤DNA要么由肿瘤细胞直接分泌到血流中，要么在细胞死亡时由这些细胞释放。下一代测序（NGS）检测可以检测提取的肿瘤DNA中的突变和其他遗传异常，还可以以非侵入性方式评估治疗期间和治疗后的微小残留病灶（MRD）。在最近的研究中，通过正电子发射断层扫描/计算机断层扫描（PET- CT）扫描测得的肿瘤DNA浓度越高，肿瘤体积越大。这些新的MRD评估方法可以检测到超出影像学检查灵敏度的残留病灶，并有可能在评估治疗反应方面补充PET- CT扫描。

这些方法正在研究中探索，目前尚未用于临床实践

欲了解更多信息，请参阅美国白血病和淋巴瘤协会（LLS）免费提供的《可测量残留病灶（MRD）》手册

如果你的医生断定治疗有效，你要么继续相同的治疗，要么成为接受强度较低疗法的候选者。例如，你的治疗团队可能会决定你在完成化疗后不接受放射治疗。如果治疗似乎没有效果，你的治疗方案可能会被调整。

Treatment of Early- Stage (Stages I- II) Favorable HL. The current treatment approach is to administer chemotherapy alone (without radiation therapy), or a combined modality therapy (combination chemotherapy followed by radiation therapy to areas of the body where lymphoma was found).

For many years, ABVD has been the most commonly used chemotherapy regimen in adults for early- stage favorable HL. ABVD is associated with very low rates of risk for later development of leukemia or infertility than many other chemotherapy combinations used for adults.

Current clinical practice guidelines for treatment of early- stage favorable HL suggest that at least 90 percent of patients can be cured with as few as two courses of ABVD followed by low- dose radiation therapy.

See Table 7 on pages 28- 29 for information on drug combinations and page 37 for pediatric regimens.

Treatment of Early- Stage (Stages I- II) Favorable HL. The current treatment approach is to administer chemotherapy alone (without radiation therapy), or a combined modality therapy (combination chemotherapy followed by radiation therapy to areas of the body where lymphoma was found).

For many years, ABVD has been the most commonly used chemotherapy regimen in adults for early- stage favorable HL. ABVD is associated with very low rates of risk for later development of leukemia or infertility than many other chemotherapy combinations used for adults.

Current clinical practice guidelines for treatment of early- stage favorable HL suggest that at least 90 percent of patients can be cured with as few as two courses of ABVD followed by low- dose radiation therapy.

Older patients (over 60 years of age) with early favorable HL may benefit from omitting the bleomycin in ABVD to avoid pulmonary (lung) toxicity. Older patients who are not candidates for chemotherapy may have radiation therapy alone.

Concerns about the late effects of radiation therapy (especially an increased risk of developing a second cancer and/or cardiac disease) have led some oncology groups to recommend the use of chemotherapy alone for some patients, particularly when the risk of developing a second cancer is considered to be significant. Patients who are at a higher risk of developing a second cancer include females younger than age 30 years who have a family history of breast cancer, and those who will have radiation therapy involving their breast tissue. See Long- Term and Late Effects of Treatment starting on page 48.

Treatment of Early- Stage (Stages I- II) Unfavorable HL. For patients in this category, the disease is considered to be high- risk yet potentially curable. Initial treatment usually consists of either a combined modality therapy (chemotherapy plus radiation therapy) or chemotherapy alone. Treatment generally involves more cycles of chemotherapy than for those in the favorable category. Results of PET- CT scans done both during and after treatment may affect decisions about the type and duration of chemotherapy and the use of radiation therapy. Some drug combinations used for treatment of these patients (see Table 7 on pages 28- 29) include:

ABVD  ABVD followed by BEACOPP

Treatment of Advanced- Stage (Stages III- IV) HL. Even in advanced stages, HL is potentially curable. In general, patients with advanced- stage HL are treated with more intense regimens of combination chemotherapy. Some drug combinations used for the treatment of these patients (see Table 7 on pages 28- 29) include:

- Brentuximab vedotin + AVD- ABVD- ABVD followed by BEACOPP- Escalated BEACOPP- BrECADD- Nivolumab + AVD

Dose- escalated BEACOPP results in good cure rates, but it puts patients at a slightly higher risk of developing leukemia or other second cancers. Patients are also at a much higher risk of infertility; for this reason, it is less commonly used. The BrECADD and N+AVD regimens are used in certain circumstances for ages 18 to 61.

Use of radiation therapy is limited to a small number of patients, including those who have areas of bulky disease (large masses) at diagnosis or those who have evidence of residual disease observed on PET- CT scans after treatment. Even in these cases, the role of radiation therapy for advanced- stage HL varies.

60 岁以上的早期预后良好的霍奇金淋巴瘤老年患者可能受益于在 ABVD 方案中省略博来霉素，以避免病毒性。不适合化疗的老年患者可能仅接受放射治疗对放射治疗远期效应的担忧（尤其是患第二种癌症和/或心脏病的风险增加）已促使一些肿瘤学团体建议对某些患者单独使用化疗，特别是当患第二种癌症的风险被认为很高时。患第二种癌症风险较高的患者包括年龄小于 30 岁且有乳腺癌家族史的女性，以及那些将接受涉及乳腺组织的放射治疗的患者

早期（I- II 期）不利型霍奇金淋巴瘤的治疗。对于此类患者中该类别中，该病被认为是高危但潜在可治愈的。初始治疗通常包括联合模式治疗（化疗加放疗）或单独化疗。治疗通常涉及比低危类别更多周期的化疗。治疗期间和治疗后进行的 PET- CT 扫描结果可能会影响化疗类型、疗程以及放疗使用的决策。用于治疗这些患者的一些药物组合（见第 28- 29 页的表 7）包括：

{ ABVD

{ ABVD 方案后续使用 BEACOPP 方案

晚期（III- IV 期）霍奇金淋巴瘤的治疗。即使在晚期，霍奇金淋巴瘤是有可能治愈的。一般来说，晚期霍奇金淋巴瘤（HL）患者接受更强化的联合化疗方案治疗。用于治疗这些患者的一些药物组合（见第 28- 29 页的表 7）包括：

{ 布伦妥昔单抗维多汀 + AVD { 强化型 BEACOPP 方案 { ABVD { BrECADD { ABVD 方案随后是 BEACOPP 方案 { 纳武利尤单抗+AVD 方案

Patients are also at a much higher risk of infertility; for this reason, it is less commonly used. The BrECADD and N+AVD regimens are used in certain circumstances for ages 18 to 61. C

Use of radiation therapy is limited to a small number of patients, including those who have areas of bulky disease (large masses) at diagnosis or those who have evidence of residual disease observed on PET- CT scans after treatment. Even in these cases, the role of radiation therapy for advanced- stage HL varies. C

# Treatment for Nodular Lymphocyte-Predominant B-cell Lymphoma (NLPBL)

Note that nodular lymphocyte- predominant Hodgkin lymphoma (NLPHL) has been reclassified as nodular lymphocyte- predominant B- cell lymphoma (NLPBL) and is no longer considered a distinct subtype of Hodgkin lymphoma. The following information is being provided while this change is being put into practice.

The cancer cells in NLPBL are a variant of Reed- Sternberg cells. They are larger than Reed- Sternberg cells and are sometimes called "popcorn" cells because their unique shape is similar to pieces of popcorn.

NLPBL tends to progress more slowly than classical HL, so the treatment approach is usually different. About 75 percent of patients with NLPBL have stage I disease at diagnosis. It is rare for NLPBL patients to have B symptoms or disease involvement outside the lymph nodes; mediastinal masses and bulky disease are also rare.

Because NLPBL is associated with an excellent long- term survival rate, the risk of overtreatment is an important consideration for these patients. Overtreatment may lead to problems and harmful side effects caused by cancer therapies that are not needed. One option for some patients is the "watch- and- wait" approach (also called "active surveillance"), in which patients are closely monitored for disease progression without getting any treatment until symptoms appear or begin to change. Other options for early- stage NLPBL without any B symptoms or bulky disease are the use of radiation therapy alone or, occasionally, surgical removal.

Combination chemotherapy may be needed in more advanced stages of the disease, with rituximab (Rituxan®) added to the regimen in some cases. Rituximab is a monoclonal antibody designed to bind to cells expressing CD20. Rituximab is often combined with chemotherapy drugs. It is sometimes used to treat NLPBL because CD20 is expressed by the lymphoma cells in this type of disease. In rituximab therapy, the monoclonal antibodies attach to and kill the lymphoma cells.

Common treatments used in advanced NLPBL include:

- R + ABVD—rituximab plus doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, dacarbazine- R + B—rituximab plus bendamustine- R-CHOP—rituximab plus cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone- R-CVP—rituximab plus cyclophosphamide, vinblastine, prednisone- Rituximab alone

# 结节性淋巴细胞为主型B细胞淋巴瘤(NLPBL)的治疗

请注意，结节性淋巴细胞为主型霍奇金淋巴瘤（NLPBL）已被重新分类为结节性淋巴细胞为主型B细胞淋巴瘤（NLPBL），不再被视为霍奇金淋巴瘤的一个独特亚型。在这一变化付诸实施期间，现将以下信息提供出来。

NLPHL中的癌细胞是里德- 斯腾伯格细胞的一种变异型。它们比里德- 斯腾伯格细胞更大，有时被称为“爆米花”细胞，因为它们独特的形状类似于爆米花片鼻型结外NK/T细胞淋巴瘤（NLPBL）通常比经典型霍奇金淋巴瘤（classicalHL）进展更缓慢，因此治疗方法通常不同。约  $75\%$  的NLPBL患者诊断时为I期疾病。NLPBL患者出现B症状或淋巴结外病变罕见；纵隔肿块和大肿块疾病也少见

由于非霍奇金淋巴瘤（NLPBL）患者长期生存率极佳，过度治疗的风险是这类患者需要重点考虑的问题。过度治疗可能导致本不必要的癌症治疗带来的问题和有害副作用。部分患者的一个选择是“观察等待”策略（也称为“主动监测”），即密切监测患者疾病进展情况，直至出现症状或症状开始变化时才进行治疗。对于无任何B症状且无巨大病灶的早期非霍奇金淋巴瘤（NLPBL）患者，其他选择包括仅采用放疗，或偶尔进行手术切除。

在疾病更晚期阶段可能需要联合化疗，在一些情况下，方案中会加入利妥昔单抗（美罗华®）

利妥昔单抗是一种设计用于结合表达CD20的细胞的单克隆抗体。利妥昔单抗常与化疗药物联合使用。它有时用于治疗非霍奇金淋巴瘤（NLPBL），因为这类疾病中的淋巴瘤细胞表达CD20。在利妥昔单抗治疗中，单克隆抗体附着并杀死淋巴瘤细胞

晚期非霍奇金淋巴瘤（NLPBL）常用的治疗方法包括：

{R+ABVD—利妥昔单抗联合阿霉素、博来霉素、长春碱、达卡巴嗪{R+B—利妥昔单抗联合苯达莫司汀{R- CHOP—利妥昔单抗联合环磷酰胺、多柔比星、长春新碱、泼尼松{R- CVP—利妥昔单抗联合环磷酰胺、长春碱、泼尼松{单独使用利妥昔单抗

NLPBL can sometimes recur many years (or even decades) after initial treatment. In a small percentage of patients (8% to 14%), it can transform into diffuse large B- cell lymphoma (DLBCL), a type of non- Hodgkin lymphoma that is usually aggressive. NLPBL is more likely to transform into DLBCL if, at the time of diagnosis, the patient presents with large tumors (bulky disease) or if lymphoma is found below the diaphragm or in the spleen. For patients with a suspected relapse of NLPBL, another biopsy should be considered to rule out transformation to DLBCL. Patients with refractory or relapsed NLPBL can be treated with second- line therapies including rituximab, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and/or autologous stem cell transplantation.

See Table 6 on pages 25- 27 for drug information.

# Treatment for Relapsed or Refractory Classical Hodgkin Lymphoma in Adults

Most patients with classical HL are cured by their initial (first- line) treatment.

However, in a small percentage of patients—especially those with advanced stage HL—the disease relapses or is refractory. Relapse means the disease comes back after a remission following treatment. Refractory means the disease has not responded to treatment. For patients whose disease is relapsed or refractory, HL is still potentially curable.

When patients are not cured with initial therapy, second- line treatment options include:

- Alternate chemotherapy combinations- Antibody-drug conjugate therapy with brentuximab vedotin- Checkpoint inhibitors, such as nivolumab or pembrolizumab- Autologous stem cell transplantation (see pages 21-22)

Talk with your treatment team to see if participating in a clinical trial is an appropriate option for you. See Clinical Trials for Blood Cancers on pages 43- 44 or visit www.LLS.org/CTSC for more information.

结节性淋巴细胞为主型霍奇金淋巴瘤（NLPBL）有时会在初始治疗后多年（甚至数十年）复发。在一小部分患者（ $8\%$  到  $14\%$  ）中，它可能转化为弥漫大B细胞淋巴瘤（DLBCL），这是一种通常具有侵袭性的非霍奇金淋巴瘤。如果在诊断时患者出现大肿瘤（大块病变），或者淋巴瘤发现于横膈以下或脾脏中，NLPBL更有可能转化为DLBCL。对于疑似NLPBL复发的患者，应考虑再次活检以排除转化为DLBCL。难治性或复发性NLPBL患者可以采用包括利妥昔单抗、化疗、放疗和/或自体干细胞移植在内的二线疗法进行治疗。

# 成人复发或难治性经典霍奇金淋巴瘤的治疗

大多数经典型霍奇金淋巴瘤患者通过初始（一线）治疗可被治愈

然而，在一小部分患者中——尤其是那些处于晚期霍奇金淋巴瘤（HL）的患者——疾病会复发或难治。复发是指治疗后缓解期后疾病复发。难治是指疾病对治疗无反应。对于疾病复发或难治的患者，霍奇金淋巴瘤仍有可能治愈。

当患者初始治疗未治愈时，二线治疗选择包括：

{ 交替化疗方案{ 维布妥昔单抗偶联药物疗法{ 检查点抑制剂，例如纳武利尤单抗或帕博利珠单抗

自体干细胞移植（见第21- 22页）

# Hodgkin Lymphoma in Children and Adolescents

Hodgkin Lymphoma in Children and AdolescentsHodgkin lymphoma (HL) is commonly diagnosed in children and young adults between the ages of 15 and 34, but it can occur in younger children between the ages of 3 and 15. It is very rare in infants.

Children and adolescents with HL have special needs for their treatment and care. Usually, specialized cancer centers for children and adolescents are best equipped to address their needs. These centers offer the advantage of having doctors called "pediatric oncologists," who have specialized training in treating children with cancer.

According to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN), the term "pediatric" includes any patient aged 18 years or younger, whereas the adolescent and young adult patient is defined as aged 15 to 39 years at the time of initial diagnosis. Adolescents with HL may be treated with either pediatric or adult protocols.

It is important for parents of children diagnosed with HL to talk to members of the oncology team about the:

- Specific subtype of the disease (see Hodgkin Lymphoma Subtypes on pages 8-9)- Stage of the disease (see Staging on pages 10-14)- Risk of treatment-related fertility issues (see Fertility Concerns on page 17)- Risk group (low-risk, intermediate-risk or high-risk). Risk group is based on the stage, tumor size (sometimes called "bulk"), and whether or not the patient has B symptoms (fever, night sweats, weight loss)- Other risk factors

Other risk factors

Doctors use all of this information about the patient's disease to determine the most effective treatment approach. They can develop treatment plans that limit the amount of therapy required to bring about remission. It is important for adult patients as well as parents of children who will be undergoing treatment, to discuss the planned therapy with members of the oncology team in order to learn about the following:

- Treatment schedule- Drugs that will be used- Potential need for radiation therapy, in some cases- Potential side effects and long-term effects

# 儿童和青少年的霍奇金淋巴瘤

霍奇金淋巴瘤（HL）通常在15至34岁的儿童和年轻成人中被诊断出来，但它也可能发生在3至15岁的年幼儿童中。它在婴儿中非常罕见

患有霍奇金淋巴瘤（HL）的儿童和青少年在治疗和护理方面有特殊需求。通常，专门的儿童和青少年癌症中心最能满足他们的需求。这些中心的优势在于有被称为“儿科肿瘤学家”的医生，他们接受过治疗儿童癌症的专门培训

根据美国国家综合癌症网络（NCCN），“儿科”一词包括任何18岁或以下的患者，而青少年和年轻成人患者定义为初诊时年龄在15至39岁之间。患有霍奇金淋巴瘤（HL）的青少年可能接受儿科或成人方案治疗

对于被诊断患有霍奇金淋巴瘤（HL）的儿童的父母来说，与肿瘤团队成员讨论以下方面是很重要的：

疾病的特定亚型（详见第8- 9页的霍奇金淋巴瘤亚型）

疾病分期（见第10- 14页的分期部分）

治疗相关的生育问题风险（见第17页的生育问题关注事项）

风险组（低风险、中风险或高风险）。风险组基于分期、肿瘤大小（有时称为“大块”）以及患者是否有B症状（发热、盗汗、体重减轻）

{其他风险因素

医生利用所有关于患者疾病的这些信息来确定最有效的治疗方案。他们可以制定治疗计划，以限制达到缓解所需的治疗量。对于成年患者以及即将接受治疗的儿童的父母来说，与肿瘤团队成员讨论计划中的治疗方案以了解以下内容非常重要：

治疗方案将要使用的药物Potential need for radiation therapy, in some cases Potential side effects and long- term effects

The option of participating in a clinical trial should also be discussed. See Clinical Trials for Blood Cancers on pages 43- 44.

Usually, one or more of the below treatment approaches, called "pediatric regimens," are used for children with HL:

- Chemotherapy--the use of potent drugs to kill or damage cancer cells- Image-guided radiation therapy (IGRT)--the use of high energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells. In IGRT, imaging scans are used for both treatment planning and during radiation therapy sessions, allowing for adjustments to improve accuracy.- Targeted therapy--the use of drugs such as antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) to target specific proteins on cancer cells, stopping their growth and spread- Immunotherapy--the use of drugs such as monoclonal antibodies and immune checkpoint inhibitors to encourage one's own immune system to work more effectively to identify and kill cancer cells- Surgery--in rare cases of NLPBL (formerly called NLPHL), doctors may completely remove a single lymph node- High-dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplantation--see Stem Cell Transplantation on pages 21-22

Children and adolescents are treated with dose- intensive regimens that are adjusted based on monitoring of early- treatment response. A patient who responds quickly to initial treatment is considered a rapid early responder (RER). A patient who responds slowly to treatment is considered a slow early responder (SER).

The following is a list of some of the many drug combinations used in first- line therapy for children and adolescents:

- ABVE--doxorubicin, bleomycin, vincristine, etoposide- ABVE-PC--doxorubicin, bleomycin, vincristine, etoposide, prednisone, cyclophosphamide- ABVD--doxorubicin, bleomycin, vincristine, dacarbazine- BEACOPP--bleomycin, etoposide, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, procarbazine, prednisone- Bv-AVE-PC--brentuximab vedotin, doxorubicin, vincristine, etoposide, prednisone, cyclophosphamide- COPP/ABV--cyclophosphamide, vincristine, procarbazine, prednisone, doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine- Escalated BEACOPP--bleomycin, etoposide, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, procarbazine, prednisone

也应该讨论参与临床试验的选项。详见第 43－44 页的血液癌症临床试验

通常，以下一种或多种称为“儿科方案”的治疗方法用于霍奇金淋巴瘤（HL）患儿：

{ 化疗——使用强效药物来杀死或破坏癌细胞的疗法{ 图像引导放射治疗（IGRT）——使用高能 X 射线或其他类型的辐射来杀死癌细胞。在图像引导放射治疗（IGRT）中，成像扫描用于治疗计划制定以及放射治疗过程中，以便进行调整以提高准确性

{ 靶向治疗——使用抗体药物偶联物（ADCs）等药物靶向癌细胞上的特定蛋白，阻止其生长和扩散

{ 免疫疗法——使用单克隆抗体和免疫检查点抑制剂等药物来促使自身免疫系统更有效地发挥作用，识别并杀死癌细胞

{ 手术——在极少数的 NLPBL（以前称为 NLPHL）病例中，医生可能会完全切除单个淋巴结

{ 大剂量化疗联合干细胞移植——见干细胞移植第 21- 22 页

儿童和青少年接受基于早期治疗反应监测进行调整的大剂量方案治疗。对初始治疗快速反应的患者被视为快速早期反应者（RER）。对治疗反应缓慢的患者被视为缓慢早期反应者（SER）

以下是用于儿童和青少年一线治疗的众多药物组合中的一些列表：

{ ABVE—多柔比星、博来霉素、长春新碱、依托泊苷{ ABVE- PC—doxorubicin, bleomycin, vincristine, etoposide, prednisone, cyclophosphamide { ABVD—doxorubicin, bleomycin, vincristine, dacarbazine { BEACOPP—bleomycin, etoposide, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, procarbazine, prednisone { Bv- AVE- PC—brentuximab vedotin, doxorubicin, vincristine, etoposide, prednisone, cyclophosphamide { COPP/ABV—cyclophosphamide, vincristine, procarbazine, prednisone, doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine { Escalated BEACOPP—bleomycin, etoposide, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, procarbazine, prednisone

Children may experience treatment- related side effects, both in the short and long term. Some effects include second cancers, cardiovascular disease, hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid) and fertility issues. Side effects can affect learning, growth, cognitive development and psychosocial development. With regular screenings and survivorship care following active treatment, these and other possible long- term and late effects can be managed. When children return to school, families will face new challenges because their main focus, up to that point, had been getting through treatment. By being aware of possible side effects, parents can work with school personnel to help their children cope and manage their schoolwork.

# Hodgkin Lymphoma and Young Adults

As with adolescents, young adults (generally considered through age 39 years) with HL may be treated with either pediatric or adult protocols. Additional studies are needed to determine preferred regimens for this population, and also how to best integrate new treatments. Notably, young adults face certain challenges unique to their age group, such as concerns about fertility, work, school, finances, health insurance, dating, parenting, etc.

For more information, see the free LLS booklets A Teen's Guide to Everything Cancer and Young Adults and Cancer.

# Hodgkin Lymphoma and Pregnancy

Because HL primarily affects adolescents and young adults, it is one of the most common types of cancer diagnosed during pregnancy. If a person is pregnant when diagnosed with HL, the treatment options depend on several factors, including: the trimester at the time of diagnosis; the stage and aggressiveness of the disease; and whether or not the patient has significant symptoms. Patients are encouraged to work closely with their hematologist- oncologist as well as a high- risk obstetrician (also called a maternal- fetal medicine specialist).

If possible, treatment should be delayed until at least the second trimester (the second 3 months) of pregnancy, because the risks of treatment to the fetus are greatest during the first trimester. For patients in their second and third trimesters, doctors may consider delaying treatment until after delivery of the baby (watchful waiting), if they determine that a delay in therapy would not impair the mother's health. Combination chemotherapy regimens given after the first trimester appear to be safe for both the mother and the baby. Treatment choices for pregnant patients with HL must be individualized, taking into consideration the patient's wishes, the symptoms and stage of the disease, and the length of time until delivery can occur safely. The timing of delivery should be carefully planned by the treatment team.

# Hodgkin Lymphoma in Older Adults

Older adults, generally defined as age 60 and older, make up approximately 20 percent of HL cases. Older adults are more likely to be diagnosed with the HL subtypes called "Mixed Cellularity" and "Lymphocyte- depleted." See Table 1 on page 9.

The presentation of HL in older adults is similar to that of younger patients. The most commonly found symptom is swollen lymph nodes, with or without

# 霍奇金淋巴瘤与年轻人

与青少年一样，霍奇金淋巴瘤（HL）的年轻成年人（一般认为是39岁以下）可能接受儿科或成人治疗方案。需要进一步研究来确定该人群的优选方案，以及如何最好地整合新疗法。值得注意的是，年轻成年人面临其年龄组特有的某些挑战，如对生育能力、工作、学业、财务、健康保险、约会、育儿等的担忧。

# 霍奇金淋巴瘤与妊娠

因为霍奇金淋巴瘤主要影响青少年和年轻人，所以它是孕期诊断出的最常见癌症类型之一。如果一个人在诊断出霍奇金淋巴瘤时处于孕期，治疗方案取决于多个因素，包括：诊断时的孕期；疾病的阶段和侵袭性；以及患者是否有明显症状。鼓励患者与他们的血液科肿瘤医生以及高危产科医生（也称为母胎医学专家）密切合作。

如果可能，治疗应推迟至妊娠至少第二个trimester（后3个月），因为妊娠第一个trimester时治疗对胎儿的风险最大。对于处于妊娠第二个和第三个trimester的患者，如果医生判定延迟治疗不会损害母亲健康，可能会考虑将治疗推迟至婴儿分娩后（观察等待）。妊娠第一个trimester后给予的联合化疗方案似乎对母亲和婴儿都安全。霍奇金淋巴瘤妊娠患者的治疗选择必须个体化，需考虑患者意愿、疾病症状和分期以及安全分娩前的时间长度。分娩时间应由治疗团队精心规划。

# 老年人霍奇金淋巴瘤

通常定义为60岁及以上的老年人约占霍奇金淋巴瘤（HL）病例的  $20\%$  。老年人更有可能被诊断为称为“混合细胞型”和“淋巴细胞消减型”的霍奇金淋巴瘤亚型。参见第9页的表1

老年人霍奇金淋巴瘤的表现与年轻患者相似。最常见的症状是淋巴结肿大，伴有或不伴有

B symptoms (unexplained fever, drenching night sweats, unexplained weight loss). See Signs and/or Symptoms on page 5.

The goal of treatment for HL in older adults is cure, with minimal harmful effects. Older adults need to be carefully evaluated for coexisting conditions as well as fitness for chemotherapy. Geriatric assessment (comprehensive evaluation of an older adult's health) is recommended to screen for frailty. Cardiac and pulmonary testing help determine a patient's suitability for certain treatments, such as an anthracycline- based therapy like doxorubicin (which can affect the heart) and/or bleomycin (which can affect the lungs).

Individualized treatment planning is essential for patients who are older than 60 years. Older adults can have more medical problems caused by treatment and a higher risk of death. It is important for patients to clearly communicate their priorities (for example, maintaining independence) and for the treatment team to understand a patient's preferences when discussing treatment options.

# Monitoring After Completion of Treatment

A PET- CT scan (see page 10) is the most accurate way to evaluate treatment response and remission status after completion of treatment. Imaging with a PET- CT scan should occur at least 3 weeks after the last chemotherapy treatment because if the scan is done earlier, temporary treatment- related inflammation could be mistaken for lymphoma masses.

Because of the risk of recurrence, periodic examination of HL patients is necessary for years after treatment. Most relapses occur within the first 2 years after completion of treatment, so follow- up visits during this time period will be more frequent, typically every 3 to 6 months. After 2 years, follow- up visits are generally scheduled every 6 to 12 months for the next 3 years until 5 years after completion of treatment.

There are long- term risks associated with HL therapy, so patients need to plan to continue their annual follow- up visits with a doctor who will monitor them for potential late complications of HL treatments, including second cancers and cardiovascular disease. See Long- Term and Late Effects of Treatment on pages 48- 50. Many comprehensive cancer centers now have "survivorship clinics" to provide patients with individualized recommendations and follow- up planning after treatment ends.

The patient's history, as well as a physical examination and blood tests, are effective assessment tools for follow- up purposes. Unless new symptoms or signs suggesting relapse are evident, follow- up CT or PET- CT scans are not recommended for ongoing monitoring of potential disease recurrence because of high false- positive rates. The decision about whether to perform imaging tests

伴有或不伴有 B 症状（不明原因发热、严重盗汗、不明原因体重减轻）。详见第 5 页的体征和/或症状

老年霍奇金淋巴瘤（HL）治疗的目标是治愈，且不良反应最小化。需要仔细评估老年人是否存在并存疾病以及是否适合化疗。建议进行老年评估（对老年人健康的全面评估）以筛查虚弱状况。心脏和肺部检查有助于确定患者是否适合某些治疗，例如基于蒽环类药物的治疗，如多柔比星（可能影响心脏）和/或博来霉素（可能影响肺部）

对于 60 岁以上的患者，制定个性化治疗方案至关重要。老年人可能会因治疗出现更多医疗问题，且死亡风险更高。患者清晰传达其优先事项（例如，保持自理能力）以及治疗团队在讨论治疗方案时了解患者的偏好非常重要

# 治疗完成后的监测

正电子发射断层显像计算机断层扫描（PET- CT）（见第 10 页）是评估治疗结束后治疗反应和缓解状态的最准确方法。PET- CT 扫描成像应在最后一次化疗治疗后至少 3 周进行，因为如果扫描进行得过早，与治疗相关的暂时性炎症可能会被误认为是淋巴瘤肿块

由于复发风险，霍奇金淋巴瘤（HL）患者在治疗后的数年中需要定期检查。大多数复发发生在治疗完成后的前 2 年内，因此在此期间的随访会更频繁，通常每 3 到 6 个月一次。2 年后，接下来的 3 年中随访通常每 6 到 12 个月安排一次，直至治疗完成后 5 年。

霍奇金淋巴瘤（HL）治疗存在长期风险，因此患者需要计划继续每年与医生进行随访，医生会监测他们霍奇金淋巴瘤治疗可能出现的晚期并发症，包括二次癌症等

心血管疾病。见治疗的长期和晚期影响，见页 48- 50. 许多综合性癌症中心现在设有“生存者诊所”，为患者在治疗结束后提供个性化建议和随访规划。

患者的病史，以及体格检查和血液检测，是用于随访目的的有效评估工具。除非有明显的提示复发的新症状或体征，否则不建议进行随访 CT 或 PET- CT 扫描以持续监测潜在的疾病复发，因为假阳性率高。关于是否进行影像学检查的决定

should be made on an individual basis, after the healthcare provider discusses the implications of their use with the patient. New technologies that seek to complement imaging techniques to assess treatment response are currently under study in clinical trials (see Monitoring Treatment Response and Assessing Measurable Residual Disease on pages 29- 30. )

# Clinical Trials for Blood Cancers

Every new cancer drug goes through a series of carefully controlled research studies before it can become part of standard cancer care. These research studies are called clinical trials and they are used to find better ways to care for and treat people with cancer.

In the United States, the FDA (U.S. Food and Drug Administration) requires that all new drugs and other treatments be tested in clinical trials before they can be used. At any given time, there are thousands of cancer clinical trials taking place. Doctors and researchers are always looking for new and better ways to treat cancer.

Researchers use cancer clinical trials to study new ways to:

- Treat cancer using    
- A new drug    
- An approved drug to treat a different kind of cancer    
- A new combination of drugs    
- A new way of giving a drug—by mouth (pill), intravenously (IV)    
- Manage cancer symptoms and ease treatment side effects    
- Find and diagnose cancer    
- Keep cancer from coming back after treatment    
- Manage long-term side effects

By taking part in a clinical trial, patients can see doctors who are experts in their disease, gain access to new, cutting- edge therapies, and provide helpful information for future patients. The treatments and information we have today are due in large part to patients being willing to join clinical trials. Anyone interested in being part of a clinical trial are encouraged to speak with their hematologist- oncologist about whether a clinical trial might be right for them. During this conversation it may help to:

- Have a list of questions to ask about the risks and benefits of each trial (visit www.LLS.org/WhatToAsk for lists of suggested questions).- Ask a family member or friend to go with you to your doctor visit—both for support and to take notes.

是否进行影像学检查的决定应在医疗保健提供者与患者讨论其使用意义后，根据个体情况做出。目前，寻求补充影像学技术以评估治疗反应的新技术正在

正在临床试验中研究（见第29－30页的监测治疗反应和评估可测量残留病灶）

# 血液癌症的临床试验

每种新的癌症药物在成为标准癌症治疗的一部分之前，都要经过一系列精心控制的研究。这些研究称为临床试验，它们用于寻找更好的照顾和治疗癌症患者的方法。

在美国，美国食品药品监督管理局（FDA）要求所有新药和其他疗法在投入使用前必须经过临床试验。在任何特定时间，都有数千项癌症临床试验正在进行。医生和研究人员一直在寻找治疗癌症的新的更好方法。

研究人员利用癌症临床试验来研究新的方法以：

{使用......治疗癌症{一种新药{一种获批用于治疗另一种癌症的药物{一种新的药物组合{ A new way of giving a drug—by mouth (pill), intravenously (IV) {Manage cancer symptoms and ease treatment side effects { Find and diagnose cancer { Keep cancer from coming back after treatment {Manage long- term side effects

# Financial Concerns

Paying for healthcare is a major concern for many people living with Hodgkin lymphoma and other blood cancers. The cost of treatment can be a financial burden as well as a worry for patients and families. In some cases, financial challenges may limit access to medications and lower adherence to treatments. There may also be significant travel and lodging expenses. Please talk with your doctor and members of your healthcare team (e.g., financial counselor, social worker, patient navigator) about your financial and other concerns. There are often resources that can help.

Health insurance usually doesn't cover all the costs of your cancer care. However, there are resources from organizations, foundations and prescription assistance programs that may be able to help. Several major pharmaceutical manufacturers provide patient assistance or prescription assistance programs. These companies may be able to help by providing both insured and uninsured patients with either free or reduced- cost medications.

LLS offers a number of financial assistance programs, as funds are available, for eligible blood cancer patients. These LLS programs may assist with co- pays, travel expenses and non- medical needs. Please contact an LLS Information Specialist at (800) 955- 4572 or visit www.LLS.org/finances to learn about the variety of LLS financial assistance programs and other resources available to patients.

For more information and resources to cope with the financial aspects of cancer care, see the free LLS booklet Cancer and Your Finances.

# Side Effects and Complications

Most side effects in patients with Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) are temporary and subside once the body adjusts to treatment, or when treatment is completed. Chemotherapy drugs attack rapidly dividing cells throughout the body, including both cancer cells and normal, healthy cells. Cells in the bone marrow, in hair follicles, and in the lining of the mouth and intestines divide quickly and may be affected by chemotherapy. The side effects of chemotherapy may vary, depending on the drugs used.

Low Blood Cell Counts. Patients who are treated with chemotherapy may experience low blood cell counts. Chemotherapy is toxic to the healthy cells in the bone marrow and may cause a deficiency of:

- Red blood cells (the cells that carry oxygen), resulting in a condition called "anemia"

# 财务担忧

支付医疗保健费用是许多患有霍奇金淋巴瘤和其他血液癌症患者的主要担忧。治疗费用可能对患者及其家人来说既是经济负担又是担忧。在某些情况下，经济挑战可能会限制药物获取并降低治疗依从性。还可能有大量的旅行和住宿费用。请与您的医生和医疗团队成员（例如，财务顾问、社会工作者、患者导航员）讨论您的经济和其他担忧。通常有一些资源可以提供帮助。

健康保险通常不会覆盖你癌症治疗的所有费用。然而，有一些来自组织、基金会和处方援助项目的资源可能能够提供帮助。几家主要的制药厂商提供患者援助或处方援助项目。这些公司可能通过为有保险和无保险的患者提供免费或低成本药物来提供帮助。

白血病及淋巴瘤协会（LLS）为符合条件的血癌患者提供若干经济援助项目，只要资金到位。这些LLS项目可能协助支付自付费用、差旅费用和满足非医疗需求。请致电（800）955－4572 联系LLS信息专家，或访问www.LLS.org/finances了解LLS提供的各类经济援助项目及患者可获取的其他资源

# 副作用和并发症

霍奇金淋巴瘤（HL）患者的大多数副作用是暂时的，一旦身体适应治疗或治疗完成，这些副作用就会消退。化疗药物会攻击全身快速分裂的细胞，包括癌细胞和正常健康细胞。骨髓、毛囊以及口腔和肠道内壁的细胞分裂迅速，可能会受到化疗的影响。化疗的副作用可能因所用药物而异。

低血细胞计数。接受化疗的患者可能会出现低血细胞计数的情况。化疗对骨髓中的健康细胞有毒性，可能导致以下缺乏：

红细胞（携带氧气的细胞），导致一种称为“贫血”的病症

Platelets (the cells that help blood clot), resulting in a condition called "thrombocytopenia"  - White blood cells (the cells that fight infection), and especially the type of white blood cell called a neutrophil, resulting in a condition called "neutropenia"

Read more about blood cells in Normal Blood and Bone Marrow on page 55.

If the number of white blood cells (particularly the type called "neutrophils") drops severely and for an extended time, patients may develop infections that require antibiotic treatment and possible hospitalization. In some types of cancer, it is necessary to allow a patient's blood cell counts to recover from these side effects before continuing treatment. Sometimes the patient's chemotherapy dosages or the time between chemotherapy cycles needs to be adjusted.

However, because HL has a high potential for cure, a low white blood cell count is not a reason to delay treatment or reduce the treatment dosage. It is uncommon for patients to continue to have low blood cell counts for a long time after the completion of treatment. However, patients who undergo stem cell transplantation may continue to be at risk for infection.

Treatment with drugs that are designed to improve white blood cell counts, such as granulocyte- colony stimulating factor (G- CSF), may be considered for patients with some types of cancer. However, in HL regimens that include bleomycin, G- CSF is not typically recommended because its use may increase the potential for lung complications. Bleomycin can damage the lungs and cause a disease called "pulmonary fibrosis." G- CSF is commonly recommended for use in regimens that combine brentuximab vedotin with chemotherapy drugs.

Infection. During treatment for HL, the deficiency of neutrophils can lead to infection from bacteria and fungi that are normally present in the environment, on the skin, and in the nose, mouth and colon. The risk of infection may increase because chemotherapy damages the lining of the mouth and intestines, making it easier for bacteria to enter the blood. When the white blood cell count is low and there is an increased risk of infection, antibiotics are given to prevent or treat infection.

Because the patient has an increased risk of developing infections, the medical staff, family and friends of the patient need to wash their hands frequently and vigorously and take other precautions to avoid exposing the patient to bacteria, viruses and other infection- causing agents. Caregivers of patients with central lines need to be meticulous in caring for these devices.

Patients at home should seek medical attention right away if any sign of infection develops. A rise in temperature to  $100.4^{\circ}$ F or higher, or the onset of chills, may be the only sign of infection in a patient with a very low white blood cell count. Other signs of infection may include: persistent coughing, tenderness at a site prone

{血小板（帮助血液凝结的细胞），导致一种称为“血小板减少症”的病症

{白细胞（对抗感染的细胞），尤其是一种叫做中性粒细胞的白细胞，导致一种称为“中性粒细胞减少症”的病症

欲了解更多关于正常血液和骨髓中血细胞的信息，请参见第55页。

如果白细胞数量（尤其是称为“中性粒细胞”的类型）大幅且长时间下降，患者可能会发生感染，需要抗生素治疗和可能的住院治疗。在某些类型的癌症中，有必要在继续治疗前让患者的血细胞计数从这些副作用中恢复。有时需要调整患者的化疗剂量或化疗周期之间的时间。

然而，由于霍奇金淋巴瘤（HL）治愈的可能性很高，白细胞计数低并不是延迟治疗或减少治疗剂量的理由。患者在治疗完成后长期持续出现低血细胞计数的情况并不常见。然而，接受干细胞移植的患者可能仍有感染风险

对于某些类型癌症的患者，可以考虑使用旨在提高白细胞计数的药物进行治疗，例如粒细胞集落刺激因子（G- CSF）。然而，在包含博来霉素的霍奇金淋巴瘤（HL）治疗方案中，通常不建议使用G- CSF，因为其使用可能会增加肺部并发症的风险。博来霉素会损害肺部并导致一种称为“肺纤维化”的疾病。G- CSF通常建议用于

将维布妥昔单抗与化疗药物联合的方案

感染。在霍奇金淋巴瘤（HL）治疗期间，中性粒细胞缺乏可导致由环境中、皮肤以及鼻、口和结肠内通常存在的细菌和真菌引起的感染。由于化疗会损害口腔和肠道的黏膜，使细菌更容易进入血液，感染风险可能会增加。当白细胞计数低且感染风险增加时，会使用抗生素来预防或治疗感染。

因为患者发生感染的风险增加，医护人员、患者的家人和朋友需要经常且用力地洗手，并采取其他预防措施，以避免患者接触细菌、病毒和其他致病病原体。有中心静脉导管患者的护理人员需要精心护理这些装置。

Patients at home should seek medical attention right away if any sign of infection develops. A rise in temperature to  $100.4^{\circ}$ F or higher, or the onset of chills, may be the only sign of infection in a patient with a very low white blood cell count. Other signs of infection may include: persistent coughing, tenderness

to infection (such as the area surrounding the anus or the facial sinuses), sore throat, pain on urination, or frequent loose stools.

One of the notable features of HL is a decrease in immune- system function; that is, the cells of the immune system do not react in normal ways. As a result, patients are susceptible to certain types of infection. Herpes zoster (shingles) is an example of a viral disease that occurs with increased frequency in patients with HL. Chemotherapy and radiation therapy can make patients more susceptible to infections because these treatments lower blood cell counts and weaken immune- system cell function.

HL patients are advised to get certain vaccinations once they have finished their treatment, including vaccinations for pneumococcal pneumonia and influenza. There are two types of pneumococcal vaccines available for adults: a pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23) and a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13, PCV15, or PCV20). A COVID- 19 vaccine is also recommended. Immunizations using live organisms or with high viral loads, such as the herpes zoster or shingles vaccine, should not be administered. Patients who have HL can receive the shingles vaccine Shingrix® because it is an "inactivated" rather than a "live" vaccine. Speak to your doctor for more information.

Other Side Effects. Reactions to chemotherapy and radiation therapy vary from person to person. Most side effects appear shortly after the initiation of treatment but should resolve once the treatment is completed.

Chemotherapy and immunotherapy side effects depend on various factors including the drug type, dose administered, length of treatment and the patient's susceptibility. Certain drugs have a specific tendency to affect certain tissues—for example, vincristine tends to affect nerve tissue, and bleomycin may affect the lungs. In addition to low blood cell counts and infection, some common side effects of immunotherapy and chemotherapy are listed below.

<table><tr><td>Acid reflux</td><td>Appetite changes</td><td>Bloating</td></tr><tr><td>Cognitive issues 
(“chemo brain”)</td><td>Constipation</td><td>Cough</td></tr><tr><td>Diarrhea</td><td>Extreme fatigue</td><td>Fever</td></tr><tr><td>Hair loss</td><td>Mouth sores</td><td>Muscle and joint pain</td></tr><tr><td>Nausea</td><td>Neuropathy (numbness and pain, usually in the hands or feet)</td><td>Rash or itchiness</td></tr><tr><td>Shortness of breath</td><td>Taste changes</td><td>Vomiting</td></tr></table>

易受感染部位的压痛（如肛门周围或面部鼻窦区域）、喉咙痛、排尿疼痛或频繁的稀便

霍奇金淋巴瘤（HL）的显著特征之一是免疫系统功能下降；也就是说，免疫系统细胞不会以正常方式做出反应。因此，患者易患某些类型的感染。带状疱疹是一种在霍奇金淋巴瘤患者中发病频率增加的病毒性疾病的例子。化疗和放疗会使患者更容易感染，因为这些治疗会降低血细胞计数并削弱免疫系统细胞的功能

霍奇金淋巴瘤（HL）患者在完成治疗后应接种某些疫苗，包括肺炎球菌性肺炎疫苗和流感疫苗。成人可用的肺炎球菌疫苗有两种：肺炎多糖疫苗（PPSV23）和肺炎结合疫苗（PCV13、PCV15或PCV20）。还建议接种新冠疫苗。不应接种使用活生物体或高病毒载量的疫苗，如带状疱疹疫苗。患有霍奇金淋巴瘤的患者可以接种带状疱疹疫苗欣安立适  $⑥$  ，因为它是“灭活”疫苗而非“活”疫苗。欲了解更多信息，请咨询您的医生。

其他副作用。对化疗和放疗的反应因人而异。大多数副作用在治疗开始后不久出现，但一旦治疗完成就应该会消退

化疗和免疫治疗的副作用取决于多种因素，包括药物类型、给药剂量、治疗时长以及患者的易感性。某些药物具有影响特定组织的特定倾向——例如，长春新碱往往影响神经组织，博来霉素可能影响肺部。除了血细胞计数低和感染之外，以下列出了免疫治疗和化疗的一些常见副作用

<table><tr><td>胃酸反流</td><td>食欲变化</td><td>腹胀</td></tr><tr><td>认知问题
(“chemo brain”) c</td><td>Constipation c</td><td>Cough c</td></tr><tr><td>Diarrhea c</td><td>Extreme fatigue c</td><td>Fever c</td></tr><tr><td>Hair loss c</td><td>Mouth sores c</td><td>Muscle and joint pain c</td></tr><tr><td>Nausea c</td><td>Neuropathy (numbness and pain, usually in the hands or feet) c</td><td>Rash or itchiness c</td></tr><tr><td>Shortness of breath c</td><td>Taste changes c</td><td>Vomiting c</td></tr></table>

Radiation therapy side effects depend on the area treated. Many people experience fatigue after radiation therapy. The skin may look and feel as if it is mildly sunburned, and it may also become dry or sore and feel painful when touched. Patients may also have short- term hair loss in the area that was treated. Treatment to the head or neck can cause mouth sores, dry mouth and changes in taste. Chest radiation can cause a dry cough or a sensation of a lump in the throat when swallowing. Radiation in the abdomen may cause nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and cramps.

It is important for patients to tell the members of their treatment team about any side effects they are experiencing. Appropriate medications may help patients feel better, and some side effects can even be prevented.

For more information, see the free LLS series of booklets Side Effect Management.

# Survivorship

According to the National Cancer Institute:

"In cancer, survivorship focuses on the health and well- being of a person with cancer from the time of diagnosis until the end of life. This includes the physical, mental, emotional, social, and financial effects of cancer that begin at diagnosis and continue through treatment and beyond. The survivorship experience also includes issues related to follow- up care (including regular health and wellness checkups), late effects of treatment, cancer recurrence, second cancers, and quality of life. Family members, friends, and caregivers are also considered part of the survivorship experience."

The information in this section applies to Hodgkin lymphoma survivors in general. See page 50 for additional information specific to childhood cancer survivors.

Long- Term and Late Effects of Treatment. Today, much is understood about the specific types of treatment for Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) and the risk for long- term or late effects. The most serious late effects experienced by long- term survivors of HL are second cancers, cardiovascular disease, lung damage, hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid) and fertility issues.

The incidence of these late effects appears to increase over time. However, the risk of late side effects may be lower with current treatments than it was with treatments used more than 10 years ago. For example, current treatments with radiation therapy tend to use less radiation and lower doses of radiation than in the past. Patients should be examined regularly by a hematologist- oncologist and should also be seen by a primary care doctor for a general health examination at least once a year.

放射治疗的副作用取决于治疗的部位。许多人在放射治疗后会感到疲劳。皮肤可能看起来和感觉像是轻度晒伤，也可能变得干燥或疼痛，触摸时会感到疼痛。患者在治疗部位也可能出现短期脱发。头部或颈部的治疗可能导致口腔溃疡、口干和味觉改变。胸部放射治疗可能导致干咳或吞咽时喉咙有异物感。腹部放射可能导致恶心、呕吐、腹泻和痉挛。

患者向治疗团队成员告知他们正在经历的任何副作用非常重要。适当的药物可能帮助患者感觉好些，而且一些副作用甚至可以预防。

# 生存状况；存活期；生存者状态

根据美国国家癌症研究所：

在癌症领域，生存照护关注癌症患者从诊断之时到生命终结的健康和福祉。这包括癌症从诊断开始并在治疗期间及之后持续的身体、心理、情感、社会和经济影响。生存照护体验还包括与随访护理（包括定期健康检查）、治疗远期影响、癌症复发、二次癌症和生活质量相关的问题。家庭成员、朋友和护理人员也被视为生存照护体验的一部分。

本节中的信息一般适用于霍奇金淋巴瘤幸存者。有关儿童癌症幸存者的其他具体信息，请参见第50页

治疗的长期和晚期影响。如今，人们对霍奇金淋巴瘤（HL）的特定治疗类型以及长期或晚期影响的风险有了较多了解。霍奇金淋巴瘤长期幸存者经历的最严重的晚期影响是二次癌症、心血管疾病、肺损伤、甲状腺功能减退（甲状腺功能低下）和生育问题。

这些远期效应的发生率似乎随时间推移而增加。然而，与10多年前使用的治疗方法相比，当前治疗的远期副作用风险可能更低。例如，当前的放射治疗往往比过去使用更少的辐射量和更低的剂量。患者应定期由血液肿瘤医生进行检查，还应每年至少由初级保健医生进行一次全面健康检查。

Second Cancer Risk. Survivors of HL are at an increased risk for developing a second cancer later in life from chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy. It is important for patients who have been treated for HL to be routinely screened for signs of a second cancer.

- Radiation Therapy. The degree of risk for developing a second cancer is related to the amount of radiation therapy given during treatment. Lung and breast cancer are the most common second cancers in HL patients. Most of these cancers develop more than 10 years after the end of treatment. The risk of developing a second cancer is highest when radiation therapy is used as a part of first-line treatment.

Female patients younger than age 30 who have radiation therapy to the breast are at risk for developing breast cancer 15 to 20 years later. Male survivors of childhood cancer may also be at risk for developing second cancers, including breast cancer, though this is rare. Radiation therapy can also injure the lungs, especially in patients who receive the chemotherapy drug bleomycin. Bleomycin is the "B" in the commonly used chemotherapy regimen ABVD, which stands for Adriamycin® (doxorubicin), bleomycin, vinblastine and dacarbazine. Survivors who have had chest radiation therapy are also at risk for lung cancer. Smoking further increases this risk, so HL survivors are advised not to start smoking or, if they do smoke, to stop. The use of e- cigarettes (also known as vaping) can cause unhealthy side effects. The long- term effects of these products are unknown, so it's best not to start their use.

- Chemotherapy. Use of chemotherapy with alkylating agents (such as cyclophosphamide or dacarbazine; see Table 5 on pages 23-24 for drug class information) increases the risk of developing another type of blood cancer called acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Chemotherapy with alkylating agents can also significantly increase the risk of other malignancies such as lung, stomach and pancreatic cancer.

Heart Disease. Radiation therapy to the chest, and treatment with certain chemotherapy drugs (anthracyclines such as doxorubicin, and some alkylating agents) has been linked to heart problems, including cardiomyopathy (damage to the heart muscle), pericarditis (inflammation of the sac surrounding the heart), valve dysfunction, and myocardial infarction (classic heart attack). Radiation may also damage the lining of blood vessels. In large arteries, this damage may lead to accelerated atherosclerosis (buildup of plaque) and an increased risk of narrowing of the blood vessels and stroke. Radiation may also increase the risk of electrical conduction abnormalities, and lead to the need for a pacemaker. Heart disease induced by radiation therapy, if it occurs, is usually observed more than 5 to 10 years after the end of treatment, but symptoms may appear at any time.

Lung Damage. Radiation therapy to the chest and treatment with chemotherapy regimens that include bleomycin are both associated with acute lung toxicity and

二次癌症风险。霍奇金淋巴瘤（HL）幸存者日后因化疗和/或放疗而患二次癌症的风险增加。接受过霍奇金淋巴瘤治疗的患者进行二次癌症迹象的常规筛查很重要。

{ 放射治疗。发生第二种癌症的风险程度与治疗期间给予的放射治疗剂量有关。肺癌和乳腺癌是霍奇金淋巴瘤患者中最常见的第二种癌症。这些癌症大多数在治疗结束10年以上后发生。当放射治疗作为一线治疗的一部分时，发生第二种癌症的风险最高。

年龄小于30岁且接受过乳房放射治疗的女性患者，在15到20年后有患乳腺癌的风险。儿童期癌症的男性幸存者也可能有患二次癌症的风险，包括乳腺癌，尽管这种情况很少见。放射治疗还可能损伤肺部，尤其是接受化疗药物博来霉素的患者。博来霉素是常用化疗方案ABVD中的“B”，ABVD代表阿霉素®（多柔比星）、博来霉素、长春碱和达卡巴嗪。接受过胸部放射治疗的幸存者也有患肺癌的风险。吸烟会进一步增加这种风险，所以霍奇金淋巴瘤幸存者被建议不要开始吸烟，或者如果已经吸烟，要戒烟。使用电子烟（也称为vaping）会导致不健康的副作用。这些产品的长期影响不明，所以最好不要开始使用它们

{ 化疗。使用含烷化剂的化疗药物（如环磷酰胺或达卡巴嗪；有关药物类别信息，参见第23- 24页的表5）会增加患另一种称为急性髓系白血病（AML）的血液癌的风险。含烷化剂的化疗还可显著增加其他恶性肿瘤的风险，如肺癌、胃癌和胰腺癌。

心脏病。胸部放疗以及某些化疗药物（如阿霉素等蒽环类药物和一些烷化剂）的治疗与心脏问题有关，包括心肌病（心肌损伤）、心包炎（心脏周围囊膜炎症）、瓣膜功能障碍和心肌梗死（典型心脏病发作）。辐射还可能损害血管内膜。在大动脉中，这种损害可能导致动脉粥样硬化加速（斑块积聚）以及血管狭窄和中风风险增加。辐射还可能增加电传导异常的风险，并导致需要安装起搏器。放疗诱发的心脏病如果发生，通常在治疗结束后5到10年以上才会被发现，但症状可能随时出现

肺损伤。胸部放疗以及包含博来霉素的化疗方案治疗均与急性肺毒性相关，并且

can also lead to reduced lung function. Some reports suggest that the use of growth factors with chemotherapy drugs significantly increases the incidence of long- term lung problems. Risk factors include older age, cumulative bleomycin dose, lung radiation and prior history of lung disease.

Thyroid Dysfunction. Radiation therapy can injure the thyroid gland, causing decreased thyroid function (hypothyroidism). The resulting deficiency of thyroid hormones can disrupt heart rate, body temperature and metabolism. Symptoms of hypothyroidism include fatigue, weight gain, constipation, dry skin and sensitivity to cold temperatures. Hypothyroidism is reported in a number of long- term HL survivors who received neck or upper chest radiation therapy.

Fertility. Patients may have decreased fertility after treatment. The risk of infertility varies according to the type and amount of chemotherapy, the area of the body exposed to radiation therapy and the patient's age. With some chemotherapy regimens, fertility appears to be affected either minimally or not at all. The ABVD (see Table 7 on pages 28- 29) regimen, for example, rarely leads to sterility (the inability to have children) in males or females. Other regimens, such as BEACOPP, may cause immediate and permanent infertility in both males and females. In addition, females who have received chemotherapy with alkylating agents may experience premature menopause. These possible side effects of chemotherapy should be taken into consideration with respect to family planning before the start of treatment. There are fertility preservation options for both males and females, so speak to the healthcare team before starting treatment. See Fertility Concerns on page 17 and for more information, see the free LLS booklet Fertility and Cancer.

In couples of childbearing ages, if only one partner has received treatment and remains fertile, the incidence of pregnancy loss and the health of the newborn are very similar to those of healthy couples.

Fatigue. Fatigue is a common long- term effect for many people who receive chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or both. Fatigue in HL survivors has also been associated with underlying heart disease, anxiety, depression and other health problems. Exercise has been shown to improve fatigue related to chemotherapy. For more information, see the free LLS booklet Cancer- Related Fatigue.

Concerns for Childhood HL Survivors. Cancer treatments can harm a child's organs, tissues or bones and may cause delayed growth and other health problems later in life. Childhood cancer survivors may have complex and long- term health issues due to the treatments they received. While treatments for HL have led to greatly increased survival rates, some may cause significant long- term or late effects, involving:

- Cognition (the mental process of thinking, learning, remembering and using judgment)

胸部放疗以及包含博来霉素的化疗方案治疗均与急性肺毒性相关，还可能导致肺功能降低。一些报告表明，化疗药物联用生长因子会显著增加长期肺部问题的发生率。风险因素包括年龄较大、博来霉素累积剂量、肺部放疗以及既往肺部疾病史。

甲状腺功能障碍。放射治疗可能损伤甲状腺，导致甲状腺功能减退（甲状腺功能低下）。由此导致的甲状腺激素缺乏会扰乱心率、体温和新陈代谢。甲状腺功能减退的症状包括疲劳、体重增加、便秘、皮肤干燥和对寒冷敏感。据报道，许多接受颈部或上胸部放射治疗的长期霍奇金淋巴瘤幸存者出现甲状腺功能减退。

生育能力。患者治疗后可能生育能力下降。不孕的风险因化疗的类型和剂量、身体接受放射治疗的部位以及患者的年龄而异。对于一些化疗方案，生育能力似乎受到的影响很小或根本不受影响。例如，ABVD方案（见第28- 29页表7）很少导致男性或女性不育（无法生育）。其他方案，如BEACOPP，可能导致男性和女性立即和永久性不育。此外，接受过烷化剂化疗的女性可能会出现过早绝经。在治疗开始前，应在计划生育方面考虑化疗的这些可能副作用。男性和女性都有保存生育能力的选择，所以在开始治疗前与医疗团队沟通。详见第17页的生育问题，欲了解更多信息，请参阅美国白血病和淋巴瘤协会的免费小册子《生育与癌症》。

在育龄夫妇中，如果仅一方接受过治疗且仍具生育能力，流产发生率和新生儿健康状况与健康夫妇非常相似

疲劳。疲劳是许多接受化疗、放疗或两者兼有的患者的常见长期影响。霍奇金淋巴瘤幸存者的疲劳也与潜在的心脏病、焦虑、抑郁和其他健康问题有关。运动已被证明可以改善与化疗相关的疲劳

欲了解更多信息，请参阅美国白血病淋巴瘤协会（LLS）免费小册子《癌症相关疲劳》

对儿童霍奇金淋巴瘤幸存者的担忧。癌症治疗可能会伤害儿童的器官、组织或骨骼，并可能导致日后生长发育迟缓及其他健康问题。儿童癌症幸存者可能由于接受的治疗而面临复杂且长期的健康问题。虽然霍奇金淋巴瘤（HL）的治疗已大幅提高了存活率，但一些治疗可能会导致明显的长期或晚期影响，包括：

{Cognition (the mental process of thinking, learning, remembering and using judgment)

- Physical development- Psychological development

Factors that influence a child's risk for developing long- term or late effects include:

- Type and duration of treatment- Sex- Age at the time of treatment- Overall health

The range and severity of these potential long- term and late effects vary. Some late effects become evident with the onset of puberty, growth and the normal aging process. Early intervention and healthy lifestyle practices (not smoking, good nutrition and exercise, regular screenings and follow- up care) may have a positive effect on the occurrence and/or severity of long- term and late effects.

It is important for parents to discuss possible late effects with members of their child's healthcare team so that the proper planning, evaluation and follow- up care can take place. See information for parents on page 53.

Follow- Up Care. Patients whose disease is in remission after completing treatment will continue to be examined regularly by their doctors. Careful periodic assessment of the patient's health may be required to evaluate the full effect of therapy, as well as to identify signs of disease relapse. Patients need to keep their doctors informed of any changes they notice in their health (for example, enlarged lymph nodes, fevers, night sweats, and the like). Over time, follow- up examinations may become less frequent.

Survivors of HL are encouraged to:

- Keep records of the treatments they have received. This information can help the doctor follow up on specific late effects that may be associated with those treatments and help the members of your healthcare team develop a schedule of follow-up examinations.

- These records should include the following information: the patient's diagnosis; the names of all drugs taken; information about any radiation therapy, surgery or transplant received; information about any other treatments, and the names and dates of any significant complications and the treatment received for those complications.

- Patients should periodically access treatment centers/doctors' portals and review their electronic medical records themselves to be sure that the information in them is complete and up to date.

{身体发育{心理发展记忆和运用判断力）影响儿童发生长期或晚期效应风险的因素包括：

{治疗类型和持续时间{性别{治疗时的年龄{整体健康

这些潜在的长期和晚期影响的范围和严重程度各不相同。一些晚期影响在青春期开始、生长和正常衰老过程中变得明显。早期干预和健康的生活方式实践（不吸烟、良好的营养和锻炼、定期检查和随访护理）可能对长期和晚期影响的发生和/或严重程度产生积极影响。

Have regular screenings for heart disease and annual blood pressure and lipid/cholesterol monitoring. A baseline cardiac stress test, echocardiogram and carotid ultrasound (for patients treated with radiation to the neck) should be considered after completion of therapy.

Have regular screenings for cancer. Cancers of the breast, lung, stomach, bone and soft tissues have been reported as early as 5 years after initial therapy for HL. If treated with radiation, an annual skin examination by a dermatologist and a monthly self- examination of the skin are recommended.

Practice monthly breast self- examination, have a yearly breast examination by a healthcare professional and have an early baseline mammogram (within 8 to 10 years after therapy or by age 40, whichever occurs earlier). It is recommended that a breast MRI be added to mammography screening for females who received radiation in the chest area when they were between the ages of 10 and 30 years. Although some females may develop breast cancer after HL treatment, it can be detected early and treated, which provides the best chance for a cure.

Have regular lung cancer screenings if a current or previous smoker and treated with chest radiation. Smoking further increases the risk of lung cancer and several other types of cancer, including acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). If you smoke, ask your doctor for strategies to help you quit. The use of e- cigarettes (vaping) is also discouraged.

Have a colonoscopy at least every 10 years. This is recommended for survivors aged 45 and older, or by age 40 for survivors at increased risk for colorectal cancer due to previous treatment. Colonoscopies may be recommended more frequently if polyps (growths) are found.

Have regular thyroid function checkups, preferably by an endocrinologist (a doctor with specialized training to diagnose, treat and manage conditions related to hormones, glands and metabolism) every year to rule out hypothyroidism, especially in patients who were treated with radiation to the neck.

Stay up to date with vaccinations appropriate for your age and circumstances. (Note that some people experience enlarged lymph nodes after receiving a COVID- 19 vaccine.)

Seek medical and psychosocial support for fatigue, depression and other long- term effects, if needed.

{定期进行心脏病筛查，并每年监测血压和血脂/胆固醇。在治疗完成后，应考虑进行基线心脏压力测试、超声心动图和颈动脉超声（针对接受颈部放疗的患者）}

{定期进行癌症筛查。有报告称，霍奇金淋巴瘤（HL）初始治疗后最早5年内就可能出现乳腺癌、肺癌、胃癌、骨癌和软组织癌。如果接受过放疗，建议每年由皮肤科医生进行皮肤检查，并每月自行检查皮肤。}

{每月进行乳房自我检查，每年由医疗专业人员进行一次乳房检查，并进行早期基线乳房X光检查（在治疗后8到10年内或40岁之前，以较早者为准）。对于10至30岁期间胸部接受过辐射的女性，建议在乳房X光检查筛查中增加乳房MRI检查。尽管一些女性在霍奇金淋巴瘤治疗后可能患乳腺癌，但可以早期发现并治疗，这为治愈提供了最佳机会}

{如果目前或曾经吸烟且接受过胸部放疗，应定期进行肺癌筛查。吸烟会进一步增加患肺癌和其他几种癌症的风险，包括急性髓系白血病（AML）和骨髓增生异常综合征（MDS）。如果你吸烟，向医生咨询帮助你戒烟的方法。也不建议使用电子烟（vaping）}

{至少每10年进行一次结肠镜检查。这一建议适用于45岁及以上的幸存者，或者因既往治疗而结直肠癌风险增加的幸存者在40岁前进行。如果发现息肉（生长物），可能会建议更频繁地进行结肠镜检查}

{定期进行甲状腺功能检查，最好每年由内分泌学家（接受过专门培训以诊断、治疗和管理与激素、腺体及代谢相关病症的医生）进行，以排除甲状腺功能减退症，尤其是接受过颈部放疗的患者}

{及时接种适合你年龄和情况的疫苗。（请注意，一些人在接种新冠疫苗后会出现淋巴结肿大的情况。）}

{如果需要，寻求针对疲劳、抑郁和其他长期影响的医疗和社会心理支持}

For parents, the Children's Oncology Group provides a downloadable Summary of Cancer Treatment template for you to fill out with the help of the members of your child's healthcare team. Visit www.survivorshipguidelines.org to download a treatment template.

Also, many hospitals and treatment centers offer survivorship clinics that specialize in long- term follow- up care for cancer survivors. Children often begin visiting a survivorship clinic 2 years after finishing cancer treatment. However, the timeline can differ based on your child's unique needs and medical history. Additionally, coordination between members of your child's cancer survivorship healthcare team and primary care pediatrician is essential.

# Incidence, Causes and Risk Factors

Although Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) can occur in both adults and children, in most patients the disease is diagnosed between the ages of 15- 34 years (see Figure 3 below). For some HL subtypes, the risk of HL rises again after age 55. For older adults, the incidence is highest at ages 80- 84 years. The disease is slightly more common among males than females.

Approximately 8,830 new cases of HL are expected to be diagnosed in 2023. This represents approximately  $10\%$  of all lymphomas in the United States. An estimated 159,867 people are living with or in remission from HL in the United States.

Causes and Risk Factors. In most cases, it is not clear what causes the genetic changes that lead to HL. There are, however, some known risk factors for HL. A "risk factor" is anything that increases a person's chance of developing a disease. Having a risk factor, though, does not mean that a person will develop

# 发病率、病因和风险因素

尽管霍奇金淋巴瘤（HL）可发生于成人和儿童，但大多数患者的疾病诊断年龄在 15 至 34 岁之间（见下图 3）。对于某些霍奇金淋巴瘤亚型，55 岁以后霍奇金淋巴瘤的风险再次升高。对于老年人，发病率在 80 至 84 岁时最高。该病在男性中比女性略为常见

预计 2023 年将约有 8830 例霍奇金淋巴瘤（HL）新发病例被确诊。这约占美国所有淋巴瘤的  $10\%$  。估计美国约有 159867 人患有霍奇金淋巴瘤或处于缓解期

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-08-10/7b35304f-50b1-429c-9cf9-36f28179ed14/b832a2fb7c0ab8b4bafac49293ff661a08034c8f916dc2dd1335df1baef4598e.jpg)

病因和风险因素。在大多数情况下，尚不清楚是什么导致了导致霍奇金淋巴瘤（HL）的基因变化。然而，霍奇金淋巴瘤有一些已知的风险因素。“风险因素”是任何增加一个人患疾病几率的因素。然而，有一个风险因素并不意味着一个人会患病

the disease. Some people with several risk factors may never develop that disease, while others with no known risk factors for a disease do. It is known with certainty that HL is not contagious.

While the causes of HL are unknown, several factors are associated with an increased risk of developing HL, including:

- Past Epstein-Barr virus infection. The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), known for causing mononucleosis, is associated with the development of some types of cancer, including HL. Infection with EBV in early childhood or having "mono" in the teenage years increases the risk of developing HL. But while the vast majority of the population has had prior infection with EBV, very few people actually develop HL.

- Age. People can develop HL at any age, but it is most common in adolescents and young adults. Certain subtypes may peak again in older adults.

- Sex. The risk of developing HL is slightly higher in males than females.

- Family history. There are occasional cases of familial clustering: having a first degree relative (parent or sibling) with HL may increase the risk of developing the disease compared with risk in the general population. There is a 10-fold higher risk in the case of same-sex siblings of patients with Hodgkin lymphoma.

- Weakened immune system. People infected with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome), have an increased risk of developing HL. People who take medicines to suppress the immune system and people with autoimmune disease are also at a higher risk of developing HL.

Since many of these risk factors cannot be changed, there is no known way to prevent most cases of HL.

这种疾病。一些有几个风险因素的人可能永远不会患上那种疾病，而另一些没有已知疾病风险因素的人却会患上。可以肯定的是，霍奇金淋巴瘤（HL）不具有传染性。

虽然霍奇金淋巴瘤（HL）的病因不明，但有几个因素与患霍奇金淋巴瘤风险增加相关，包括：

{既往EB病毒感染。以引起单核细胞增多症而闻名的EB病毒（EBV）与某些类型癌症的发生相关，包括霍奇金淋巴瘤（HL）。儿童早期感染EBV或青少年时期患“单核细胞增多症”会增加患霍奇金淋巴瘤的风险。但尽管绝大多数人既往感染过EBV，实际上只有极少数人会患上霍奇金淋巴瘤

{年龄。人们在任何年龄段都可能患霍奇金淋巴瘤，但它在青少年和年轻人中最常见。某些亚型可能在老年人中再次达到高峰。

{性别。男性患霍奇金淋巴瘤（HL）的风险略高于女性。

{家族史。偶尔有家族聚集的病例：与普通人群相比，一级亲属（父母或兄弟姐妹）患有霍奇金淋巴瘤（HL）可能会增加发病风险。霍奇金淋巴瘤患者的同性兄弟姐妹患病风险高10倍。

{免疫系统减弱。感染导致艾滋病（获得性免疫缺陷综合征）的人类免疫缺陷病毒（HIV）的人，患霍奇金淋巴瘤（HL）的风险增加。服用抑制免疫系统药物的人和患有自身免疫性疾病的人患霍奇金淋巴瘤（HL）的风险也更高。

由于这些风险因素中有很多无法改变，目前没有已知的方法来预防大多数霍奇金淋巴瘤病例。

# Normal Blood and Bone Marrow

Blood. Blood is the liquid that flows through a person's arteries and veins. It carries oxygen and nutrients throughout the body. It also carries away waste products. Blood is composed of plasma and cells.

Plasma. Plasma is largely made up of water, in which many chemicals are dissolved. These chemicals each have a special role. They include:

# $\bigcirc$  Proteins

$\bigcirc$  Albumin, the most common blood protein  $\bigcirc$  Blood- clotting proteins (coagulation factors) made by the liver  $\bigcirc$  Erythropoietin, a protein made by the kidneys that stimulates red blood cell production  $\bigcirc$  Immunoglobulins, proteins that help the body fight infection

$\bigcirc$  Hormones, such as thyroid hormone and cortisol

$\bigcirc$  Minerals, such as iron and magnesium

$\bigcirc$  Vitamins, such as folate (B9) and vitamin B12

$\bigcirc$  Electrolytes, such as calcium, potassium and sodium

Blood Cells. Blood cells are formed in the bone marrow, a spongy tissue where blood cells grow and develop. Blood cells start as stem cells. The process of stem cells maturing into blood cells is called "hematopoiesis." The blood cells are suspended in the plasma. See Figure 4 on page 57.

Once the stem cell is created, it will develop into one of the three types of blood cells:

1. Red blood cells (RBCs) (the cells that carry oxygen)

$\bigcirc$  These make up a little less than half of the body's total blood volume.

$\bigcirc$  They are filled with hemoglobin, the protein that picks up oxygen from the lungs and takes it around the body. It binds with carbon dioxide (CO2) and removes it from the cells and then brings it back to the lungs. When a person exhales (breathes out), the CO2 is removed from the lungs.

2. Platelets (the cells that help blood to clot)

$\bigcirc$  These are small cells (one- tenth the size of red blood cells).  $\bigcirc$  They help stop bleeding from an injury or cut.  $\bigcirc$  They stick to the torn surface of the vessel, clump together and plug up the bleeding site. They form a clot with the help of proteins, such as fibrin and electrolytes such as calcium.

# 正常血液和骨髓

血液。血液是流经人体动脉和静脉的液体。它将氧气和营养物质输送到全身。它还带走废物。血液由血浆和细胞组成。

血浆。血浆主要由水组成，其中溶解着许多化学物质。这些化学物质各自有特殊的作用。它们包括：

# { 蛋白质

{ 白蛋白，最常见的血液蛋白  { 由肝脏产生的凝血蛋白（凝血因子）  { 促红细胞生成素，一种由肾脏产生的刺激红细胞生成的蛋白质

{ 免疫球蛋白，帮助身体对抗感染的蛋白质

{ 激素，如甲状腺激素和皮质醇

{ 矿物质，例如铁和镁

{ 维生素，例如叶酸（B9）和维生素B12

{ 电解质，如钙、钾和钠

血细胞。血细胞在骨髓中形成，骨髓是一种海绵状组织，血细胞在其中生长和发育。血细胞起始于干细胞。干细胞成熟为血细胞的过程称为“造血作用”。血细胞悬浮在血浆中。见图57的图4。

一旦干细胞被创建，它将发育成三种血细胞中的一种：

1. 红细胞（RBCs）（携带氧气的细胞）

{ 这些构成了身体总血容量的略少于一半

{ 它们充满了血红蛋白，这种蛋白质从肺部摄取氧气并将其输送到全身。它与二氧化碳（ $\mathsf{CO}_2$ ）结合，将其从细胞中移除，然后将其带回肺部。当一个人呼气（呼出气体）时，二氧化碳从肺部被排出。

2. 血小板（帮助血液凝结的细胞）

{ 这些是小细胞（是红细胞大小的十分之一）

{ 它们有助于止住伤口或割伤的出血

{ 它们附着在血管的撕裂表面，聚集在一起并堵塞出血部位。它们在诸如纤维蛋白之类的蛋白质和诸如钙之类的电解质的帮助下形成血块

3. White blood cells (WBCs). These are the cells that fight infections. They include:

Neutrophils and monocytes. These cells, called "phagocytes," ingest and destroy bacteria and fungi. Unlike red blood cells and platelets, monocytes can leave the bloodstream and enter tissues to attack invading organisms and fight off infection.

Eosinophils and basophils. These WBCs respond to allergens or parasites.

Lymphocytes. These WBCs, found mostly in the lymph nodes, spleen and lymphatic channels, are a key part of the immune system. Some enter the bloodstream. There are three major types of lymphocytes:

- T lymphocytes (T cells)- B lymphocytes (B cells)- Natural killer cells (NK cells)

Bone Marrow. In healthy people, stem cells in the bone marrow produce new blood cells continuously. When blood cells are fully developed, they enter the bloodstream as it passes through the marrow and then circulate throughout the body.

In babies, all bones have active marrow. By the time a person reaches young adulthood, the bones of the hands, feet, arms and legs no longer have bloodforming marrow. In adults, marrow is only found in the spine (vertebrae), hip and shoulder bones, ribs, breastbone and skull.

Hematopoietic stem cells are found in the marrow. These stem cells are important because they can be used for transplants. Some stem cells enter the bloodstream and circulate. Doctors know how to stimulate the growth of these cells in the marrow and make them migrate into the bloodstream. Then a special technique called "apheresis" is used to separate them from the circulating blood so they can be collected and stored. Stem cells from the placenta and the umbilical cord of a newborn infant can also be harvested and used for future transplantation.

3. 白细胞 (WBCs)。这些是对抗感染的细胞。它们包括：

{ 中性粒细胞和单核细胞。这些被称为“吞噬细胞”的细胞摄取并消灭细菌和真菌。与红细胞和血小板不同，单核细胞可以离开血液进入组织，攻击入侵的生物体并抵御感染。

{ 嗜酸性粒细胞和嗜碱性粒细胞。这些白细胞对变应原或寄生虫作出反应。

{ 淋巴细胞。这些白细胞主要存在于淋巴结、脾脏和淋巴管中，是免疫系统的关键组成部分。一些进入血流。淋巴细胞主要有三种类型：

{ T 淋巴细胞 (T 细胞)  { B 淋巴细胞 (B 细胞)  { 自然杀伤细胞 (NK 细胞)

骨髓。在健康人群中，骨髓里的干细胞持续产生新的血细胞。当血细胞完全发育后，它们会在流经骨髓时进入血流，然后在全身循环。

在婴儿期，所有骨骼都有活跃的骨髓。到一个人进入青年期时，手、脚、手臂和腿部的骨骼不再有造血骨髓。在成年人中，骨髓仅存在于脊柱（椎骨）、髋骨和肩骨、肋骨、胸骨和颅骨中。

造血干细胞存在于骨髓中。这些干细胞很重要，因为它们可用于移植。一些干细胞进入血流并循环。医生知道如何刺激这些细胞在骨髓中生长并使其迁移到血流中。然后使用一种称为“单采术”的特殊技术将它们从循环血液中分离出来，以便收集和储存。新生儿的胎盘和脐带中的干细胞也可以被采集并用于未来的移植

# Figure 4. Blood Cell and Lymphocyte Development

Figure 4. Blood Cell and Lymphocyte DevelopmentMost blood cells start as hematopoietic (blood) stem cells in the bone marrow. Hematopoietic stem cells are the most immature blood- forming cells. They must mature (go through many stages) to become a red blood cell, white blood cell or platelet. Some blood cells mature in the bone marrow. Other blood cells leave the bone marrow and travel to other parts of the body to develop into mature blood cells.

图 4. 血细胞和淋巴细胞发育大多数血细胞最初是骨髓中的造血（血液）干细胞。造血干细胞是最不成熟的造血细胞。它们必须成熟（经历多个阶段）才能成为红细胞、白细胞或血小板。一些血细胞在骨髓中成熟。其他血细胞离开骨髓，前往身体的其他部位发育成成熟的血细胞。

The lymphatic system comprises the tissues and organs that produce, store and carry lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell) that fight infection and other diseases. This system includes the bone marrow, spleen, and thymus. Lymph nodes and lymphatic vessels (a network of thin tubes that carry lymph and white blood cells.) See Figure 1 on page 4.

The bone marrow is really two organs in one. It is (1) the organ that forms blood cells, and it is (2) the organ that forms lymphocytes, which make up part of the immune system.

The marrow produces three main types of lymphocytes. They are:

- B lymphocytes (B cells), which make antibodies in response to foreign antigens, especially microbes- T lymphocytes (T cells), which mature in the thymus. The T lymphocytes have several functions, including assisting B lymphocytes to make antibodies against invading bacteria, viruses or other microbes. The antibody attaches to the microbe, making it possible for other white blood cells to recognize the antibody and pull it into the cell (ingest it) along with its attached microbe. The white blood cell then kills and ingests the microbe.- Natural killer (NK) cells, which attack virus-infected cells or tumor cells without requiring an antibody or other substances. T cells and NK cells have other functions as well, and are important elements in research efforts to design immunotherapies to treat lymphoma and other cancers.

The lymphocytes circulate through channels called "lymphatics," which connect the lymph nodes to each other throughout the body. The lymphatic channels collect into large ducts that empty into blood vessels. Lymphocytes enter the blood via these ducts. Most lymphocytes are found in the lymph nodes and other parts of the lymphatic system, such as the skin, spleen, tonsils and adenoids, intestinal lining, and (in young people) the thymus.

# 淋巴系统

淋巴系统包括产生、储存和输送淋巴细胞（一种对抗感染和其他疾病的白细胞）的组织和器官。这个系统包括骨髓、脾脏和胸腺。淋巴结和淋巴管（输送淋巴液和白细胞的细管网络）。见图4的图1。

骨髓实际上是一个兼具两种功能的器官。它（1）是生成血细胞的器官，（2）是生成淋巴细胞的器官，而淋巴细胞是免疫系统的一部分。

骨髓产生三种主要类型的淋巴细胞。它们是：

{B淋巴细胞（B细胞），它们产生抗体以应对外来抗原，尤其是微生物

{T淋巴细胞（T细胞），在胸腺中成熟。T淋巴细胞具有多种功能，包括协助B淋巴细胞产生针对入侵细菌、病毒或其他微生物的抗体。抗体附着在微生物上，使得其他白细胞能够识别该抗体，并将其连同附着的微生物一起拉入细胞内（吞噬它）。然后白细胞杀死并吞噬该微生物。

{自然杀伤（NK）细胞，它们攻击被病毒感染的细胞或肿瘤细胞，而无需抗体或其他物质。T细胞和NK细胞也有其他功能，并且是设计治疗淋巴瘤和其他癌症的免疫疗法的研究工作中的重要组成部分

淋巴细胞通过称为“淋巴管”的通道循环，这些通道将全身的淋巴结彼此连接起来。淋巴管汇集形成大的导管，这些导管汇入血管。淋巴细胞通过这些导管进入血液。大多数淋巴细胞存在于淋巴结和淋巴系统的其他部位，如皮肤、脾脏、扁桃体和腺样体、肠黏膜以及（在年轻人中）胸腺。

# Health Terms

Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplantation. A treatment that uses donor stem cells to restore a patient's damaged and diseased bone marrow after they receive high doses of chemotherapy. See the free LLS booklet Blood and Marrow Stem Cell Transplantation.

Anemia. A condition in which the number of red blood cells is below normal. This results in a diminished ability of the blood to carry oxygen. Severe anemia can cause a pale complexion, weakness, fatigue and shortness of breath.

Antibody. A type of protein created by blood cells in response to an antigen (a substance that causes a specific immune response in the body). Antibodies help the body fight against these "invaders" that make a person sick. Antibodies can also be made in the laboratory and are used to help identify and treat certain types of cancer.

Antigen. A foreign substance, usually a protein, that stimulates an immune response when it is ingested, inhaled, or comes into contact with the skin or mucous membranes. Examples of antigens are bacteria, viruses and allergens.

Autologous Stem Cell Transplantation. A treatment in which stem cells are removed from a patient, stored, and then returned to the patient's bloodstream after the patient receives intensive chemotherapy. See the free LLS booklet Blood and Marrow Stem Cell Transplantation.

B Symptoms. Symptoms caused by the lymphoma, including high fevers, drenching night sweats, and rapid weight loss without dieting.

Biopsy. A procedure to remove cells or tissue from the body for examination by a pathologist. The pathologist may study the sample under a microscope or perform other tests on the cells or tissue.

Bone Marrow. The spongy tissue in the hollow central cavity of the bones, where blood cell formation occurs. It produces red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets. After puberty, the bone marrow in the spine, ribs, breastbone, hips, shoulders and skull is most active in blood cell formation. In adults, the bones of the hands, feet, legs and arms do not contain blood- forming marrow (in these sites, the bone marrow is filled with fat cells). When bone marrow cells have matured into blood cells, they enter the blood that passes through the bone marrow and are carried throughout the body in the bloodstream.

# 健康术语

Bone Marrow Aspiration. A procedure in which a sample of liquid bone marrow is removed, usually from the hip (pelvic) bone. After medication is given to numb the skin and the surface of the bone underneath, a special needle is inserted into the bone to remove a liquid sample of bone marrow. The bone marrow sample is sent to a laboratory for examination by a pathologist. This procedure is almost always done at the same time as a bone marrow biopsy.

Bone Marrow Biopsy. A procedure in which a small sample of bone containing bone marrow is removed, usually from the hip (pelvic) bone. It differs from bone marrow aspiration in that a sample of actual bone is removed, rather than a liquid sample. After medication is given to numb the skin, a special hollow biopsy needle is used to remove a core sample of bone. The sample is sent to a laboratory to be examined under a microscope. This procedure is almost always done at the same time as a bone marrow aspiration.

突变。细胞中脱氧核糖核酸（DNA）序列的改变。突变可能由细胞分裂时的错误引起，也可能由接触环境中破坏DNA的物质引起。某些突变可能导致癌症或其他疾病。

Neutropenia. A decrease below normal in the concentration of neutrophils, a type of white blood cell.

Neutrophil. A type of white blood cell that helps fight infection by ingesting microorganisms and releasing enzymes that kill microorganisms. People with some types of blood cancer, or who have received treatment (such as chemotherapy) for cancer, usually have low neutrophil counts. People with low neutrophil counts are very susceptible to infections.

Oncologist. A doctor who has special training in diagnosing and treating cancer.

Pathologist. A doctor who has special training in identifying diseases by studying cells and tissues under a microscope.

PET Scan. See Positron Emission Tomography (PET) Scan.

PET- CT Scan. See Positron Emission Tomography- Computed Tomography (PET- CT) Scan.

Port. A small device that is used to access a central venous line to withdraw blood from patients and to give them treatments, including intravenous fluids, drugs and/or blood transfusions. The port is placed under the skin, usually in the chest. It is attached to a central line (a thin, flexible tube) that is guided into a large vein. A central line and port may stay in place for weeks or months. See Central Line.

Positron Emission Tomography (PET) Scan. A procedure that uses a scanner to make detailed computerized pictures of areas inside the body. A small amount of radioactive glucose, a type of sugar called FDG, is also used. Because cancer cells absorb more sugar than normal cells, the glucose helps in locating cancer cells.

Positron Emission Tomography- Computed Tomography (PET- CT) Scan. A procedure that combines two powerful imaging techniques, a PET scan and a CT scan. The two scans are done at the same time with the same machine. The combined scans give more detailed pictures of areas inside the body than either scan alone. A PET- CT scan may be used to help diagnose cancer, plan treatment, or determine how well treatment is working.

Prognostic Factor. A condition or characteristic of a patient that can be used to estimate the chance of recovery from a disease.

中性粒细胞减少症。中性粒细胞（一种白细胞）浓度低于正常水平的减少

中性粒细胞。一种白细胞，通过摄取微生物并释放杀死微生物的酶来帮助对抗感染。患有某些类型血癌的人，或接受过癌症治疗（如化疗）的人，通常中性粒细胞计数较低。中性粒细胞计数低的人非常容易感染。

肿瘤学家。专门接受过癌症诊断和治疗培训的医生。

病理学家。通过在显微镜下研究细胞和组织来识别疾病的专科医生。

正电子发射断层扫描（PET）。参见正电子发射断层扫描（PET）扫描

正电子发射断层扫描- 计算机断层扫描（PET- CT）检查。见正电子发射断层扫描- 计算机断层扫描（PET- CT）检查

端口。一种小型装置，用于接入中心静脉导管，从患者体内抽取血液并为他们进行治疗，包括静脉输液、药物和/或输血。端口置于皮肤下，通常在胸部。它连接到一根中心导管（一根细的、柔韧的管子），该导管被引导进入一条大静脉。中心导管和端口可能会保留数周或数月。参见中心导管。

正电子发射断层扫描（PET）检查。一种使用......的程序

扫描仪来生成体内区域的详细计算机图像。还会使用少量放射性葡萄糖，一种称为氟代脱氧葡萄糖（FDG）的糖类。因为癌细胞吸收的糖分比正常细胞多，所以葡萄糖有助于定位癌细胞

正电子发射断层显像- 计算机断层扫描（PET- CT）检查

一种结合了两种强大成像技术的程序，即正电子发射断层扫描（PET）和计算机断层扫描（CT）。这两种扫描在同一台机器上同时进行。联合扫描比单独的任何一种扫描都能提供体内区域更详细的图像。正电子发射断层扫描- 计算机断层扫描（PET- CT）可用于帮助诊断癌症、规划治疗或确定治疗效果如何

预后因素。患者的一种状况或特征，可用于评估从疾病中康复的几率

Radiation Therapy. The use of x- rays and other forms of radiation in cancer treatment. Radiation therapy may be useful in the treatment of localized lymphoma masses.

Refractory. This term refers to particular cases of a disease, such as Hodgkin lymphoma and other cancers, that do not respond to treatment. A disease can be refractory in newly diagnosed or relapsed cases.

Relapse. The return of a disease after a period of improvement or remission.

Remission. A decrease or disappearance of the signs and symptoms of a disease. Remission usually follows treatment. The terms "complete" and "partial" are sometimes used to further define remission. Complete remission means that all evidence of the disease is gone. Partial remission means that the disease is significantly improved by treatment, but some evidence of the disease remains.

Second- Line Therapy. Treatment that is given when the initial ("first- line") therapy does not work or stops working.

Spleen. An organ of the lymphatic system located in the left upper portion of the abdomen, just under the left side of the diaphragm. Blood and lymphatic fluid circulate through the spleen, which filters out debris such as bacteria and old blood cells.

Staging. The use of exams and tests to determine if and how far a cancer has spread throughout the body. Staging provides important information for treatment planning.

Stem Cell Transplantation. See Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplantation and Autologous Stem Cell Transplantation.

Thrombocytopenia. A decrease below normal in the number of platelets (thrombocytes) in the blood.

Toxic. Used to describe a substance that is poisonous or harmful to cells in the body.

World Health Organization (WHO). An agency of the United Nations that deals with major health issues around the world. The WHO sets standards for health care and medicines and publishes scientific papers and reports.

放射治疗。在癌症治疗中使用 X 射线和其他形式的辐射。放射治疗可能对局部淋巴瘤肿块的治疗有用。

难治性。这个术语指的是疾病的特定病例，例如霍奇金淋巴瘤和其他癌症，这些病例对治疗没有反应。

一种疾病在初诊或复发病例中可能是难治性的

复发。疾病在一段时间的好转或缓解后复发。

缓解。疾病体征和症状的减轻或消失。缓解通常出现在治疗之后。“完全”和“部分”这两个术语有时用于进一步定义缓解。完全缓解意味着疾病的所有迹象都消失了。部分缓解意味着疾病通过治疗显著改善，但仍有一些疾病迹象存在。

二线治疗。当初始（“一线”）治疗无效或不再起作用时进行的治疗

脾脏。淋巴系统的一个器官，位于腹部左上部分，正好在横膈膜左侧下方。血液和淋巴液流经脾脏，脾脏过滤掉细菌和衰老血细胞等碎屑。

分期。使用检查和测试来确定癌症是否以及在体内扩散的程度。分期为治疗方案制定提供重要信息。

干细胞移植。见异基因干细胞移植和自体干细胞移植。

血小板减少症。血液中血小板（血栓细胞）数量低于正常水平的减少

有毒的；用于描述对体内细胞有毒或有害的物质

世界卫生组织（WHO）。联合国的一个机构

处理全球主要健康问题。世界卫生组织制定医疗保健和药品标准，并发布科学论文和报告。
